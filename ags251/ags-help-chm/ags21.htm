AGS now supports user-written plugins in order to provide functionality to your game
that AGS itself does not support.<P>
The plugin developer's guide is available from the Resources section of the AGS website.<P>
Plugins come as DLL files with the names  AGS*.DLL, for example  agscircle.dll  might be a
plugin providing a DrawCircle text script function. To use a plugin, place it in the AGSEDIT
directory (not your game folder).<P>
Start the AGS Editor up with the plugin in its folder, and load your game. Go to the Game
menu, and select Plugin Manager. There, you should see all available plugins listed. To use
one in your game, check the box next to it and press OK. The plugin developer should provide
instructions on how then to use their plugin. Save your game to make sure that AGS remembers
that you want to use the plugin.<P>

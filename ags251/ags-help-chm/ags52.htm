<H2>Interpreter issues</H2>
<B>Q. The engine quits with "Aborting due to signal SIGxxxx, Shutting down
   allegro" and a load of numbers. What's going on?</B><P>
A. You may have found a bug in the engine. First of all, check that you
   haven't done anything silly, like assigning a view number to an object
   where the view doesn't exist.
   Otherwise, try and work out when the problem happens - does it always
   happen at the same time (like whenever you turn an object on).
   Write down the list of numbers (each begins with "0x") and mail me with
   the problem. Even better, take a screen shot of the complete error display
   and send me that.<P>
<B>Q. When I choose the 960x600 mode in Setup, the game appears in a box in the
   middle of the screen surrounded by black borders. What's wrong?</B><P>
A. Nothing, that's just how it is. The reason: a monitor can only use certain
   specific resolutions, like 320x200, 640x400, 640x480, 1024x768, and so on.
   So, to get the 960x600 mode, AGS tells the monitor to use its 1024x768 mode,
   and place the game window in the centre.<P>
<B>Q. Then why doesn't AGS support a 1024x768 mode?</B><P>
A. For compatibility. The lowest resolution supported is 320x200, and all
   other supported resolutions are multiples of this. This gives 640x400 and
   960x600. Without this, AGS would be stuck in 1024x768 and would not allow
   different video modes. Whether you think that would be a good thing or
   not isn't the issue :-)<P>
<B>Q. I don't get sound under Windows 2000!</B><P>
A. This is due to the way that Windows 2000 works, and cannot be fixed for
   the DOS engine. You need to run the Windows version of the engine instead,
   which will give you sound using DirectX.<P>

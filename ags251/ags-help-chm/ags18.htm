<H2>Dumping text to file</H2>
AGS now has the ability to dump all of your in-game text out to a flat text
file, which you can edit by hand and then import back later.
This is useful if you need to edit lots of scripts or messages for some reason,
and then recombine them all back into the game.<P>
To dump your game's text, choose the "Dump game text to file" option from the
Game menu.
Here you get five check-boxes where you can choose which parts of the game
you want exported. You may wish to just tick all the boxes. Once done, click the "Dump
It!" button, type a file name, and click OK. 
You should find that file inside your game's folder ready to be edited.<P>
<I>NOTE: The file contains special tags, which look like this:</I><P>
<TT>$$$!$$$ GM 3</TT><P>
<I><B>DO NOT MODIFY THESE LINES IN ANY WAY.</B> They are used by AGS to track what
each line of the file means, and changing any of the special lines could
really mess up your game when you import it back.</I><P>
When you have made your changes to the text file, and want to combine it back
into the game, first of all MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR GAME FOLDER. Because
the import operation jibbles every part of your game, if it crashes or messes
up at any point, your game is most likely lost. So, make a backup of your
game before proceeding.<P>
Once done, choose "Import dumped text from file" on the Game menu, select the
things you want to import back in, then click the "Import" button.
There you can select the text file to import, and it should import everything back in.<P>
In conclusion, the Dump Text feature is a very powerful tool, however you <B>must</B>
be careful with its use or you could corrupt your game beyond repair.<P>

<H2>FAQ and Troubleshooting</H2>
This section is split up into three parts:
<UL>

<LI> frequently asked questions, which answers questions people have about
the system, rather than problems using it.
<LI> run-time engine problems, which deals with problems getting the engine
to run, sound card issues, crashes, and other game-independant problems.
<LI> game creation problems, which deals with common problems you are having
with your specific game.
</UL>
<P>
Please refer to the online Knowledge Base for a proper list of current
bugs and fixes. It's under the "Support" link on the AGS website. This
section of these docs is very rarely updated.<P>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Using your own graphics</h3>
      <p dir="ltr">When you were choosing the graphics for the object earlier in this
      tutorial, you probably noticed that the images available didn't look up
      to much. This is no problem, because you can import your own graphics
      using the Sprite Manager.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Double-click <i>&quot;Sprites&quot;</i> near the top of the 
		project tree.
      This opens up the Sprite Manager, where you can see the complete sprite set for the game.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">AGS uses these sprites for all game graphics, except room backgrounds. The
      Sprite Manager is the central place where you do all your graphics
      importing. Whenever you want to use images in the game (for mouse
      cursors, views, objects, etc), you select an image to use
      from here.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">There are two ways to import your graphics - either overwrite an
      existing sprite with your graphic, or create a new slot for it. To overwrite
      an existing sprite, right-click the sprite and select <i>&quot;Replace 
		sprite from file&quot;</i>. To import a new slot, right-click on the background
      of the window and choose <i>&quot;Import new sprite from file&quot;</i>. 
		If your game is hi-colour, you'll also have options to paste from the 
		clipboard.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Note that the sprite graphics you import must be the same colour depth as your
      backgrounds - ie. if you have a 256-colour game, you must import
      256-colour sprites.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_1.jpg" width="543" height="394"><br>
      Right-clicking to replace existing sprite</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr">So, let's replace the default key image with something of our 
		own. Right-click on it and choose &quot;<i>Replace sprite from file</i>&quot;. 
		Select the file that you want in the dialog, and then you'll be 
		presented with this:<p align="center" dir="ltr"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_2.jpg" width="616" height="440"><br>
      The &quot;Import Sprite&quot; window</i><p dir="ltr">This is the Import 
		Sprite window. You'll see the image from the file that you chose, along 
		with various options. The Zoom slider on the left allows you to zoom in 
		on the image (very useful for 320x200-resolution graphics), and the 
		&quot;Transparent colour&quot; option allows you to choose how AGS decides which 
		colour is the image's transparent colour.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Now, you have two choices. If you want to import the whole 
		image, just click the &quot;Import Whole Image&quot; button, and you're done. If 
		on the other hand you only want to import a portion of the image, then 
		you need to right-drag the mouse within the image to select the area 
		that you want to import. Once you've got it right, left-click to confirm 
		and the selected area of the image will be imported.</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> For character graphics, make sure you import graphics that 
		are a suitable size for the game backgrounds. For example, don't import 
		a 320x200-sized image for your character, since it will take up the 
		whole screen. A good size would be about 20x50 pixels. This will look 
		really small in the Import window, but your game runs at a much lower 
		resolution so it'll look much larger.<br>
&nbsp;<table border="0" id="table3">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td><i><b>NOTE</b> (256-colour only): </i>You may well find that the
            colours on your graphic look slightly strange once you've imported 
			the image.
            This is because by default only the
            first 41 of the palette colours are allocated to sprites, so your graphic will be remapped to
            this much smaller palette. If you find that many of your imported
            sprites look strange, you can increase the number of colours
            assigned to sprites, at the expense of background colours (see the
            earlier part of the tutorial for palette setup).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h4>Tiled sprite import</h4>
      <p>This feature allows you to import a grid of sprites into separate slots
      - for example, if you have several frames of a character animation side by
      side in the source bitmap. To do this, simply check the &quot;Tiled sprite
      import&quot; box, and align your rectangle on the top left sprite. When
      you click the left mouse button, you will get an extra step which allows
      you to size the grid:<p>Click the left button again once you are happy with the grid. Each of
      the cells will be imported as a separate sprite.<br>

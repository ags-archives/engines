<H2>The Wavetable Synth MIDI driver</H2>
This driver, only available with the DOS engine, uses a MIDI patch set to play MIDI
music through the digital sound driver, thus meaning that the music will sound
the same on all sound cards. This is particularly useful for standard Sound Blaster
cards, where the built-in MIDI chips on the card sound very crappy.<P>
This driver is never autodetected; the player must choose it specifically
by running the Setup program. Note that since it uses the digital driver to
play the sound, you must have a digital sound card installed in the system
for it to work. Also note that it will slightly slow down the game over just
using a standard MIDI driver.<P>
To use the wavetable driver, you need to get the General MIDI patch set, which
you can download from the AGS website (it's 1.5 Mb, that's why it's only
available seperately). If the patch set is not found in the AGS directory,
then Setup will not allow you to choose the driver.<P>

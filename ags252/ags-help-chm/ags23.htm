      Text Scripting Tutorial - Part 2</b></h2>
      <h3> &nbsp;
      </h3>
      <h3>Recap
      </h3>
      <p>In the first tutorial, we covered the basics of scripting - how to
      write a simple script, use variables and conditional statements. You now
      know how to call all the built-in functions and write a fairly decent
      script. So, what's next?
      </p>
      <h3><br>
      Loops
      </h3>
      <p>You may find it useful to have a sequence of commands that are executed
      more than once. AGS supports this, using the <i>while</i> keyword. Its
      format is virtually identical to <i>if</i>:
      </p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  int counter = 1;
  while (counter &lt; 10) {     
    counter ++;
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This means that the body of the <i>while</i> statement is repeatedly
      processed, as long as the condition is true. So, in this case, since
      counter starts as 1, the loop will be run 9 times, since on the tenth time
      counter will be 10 and therefore it will stop.&nbsp;<p><i><b>NOTE</b></i>:
      be careful with while loops - it is possible to crash your game by using a
      badly written one. Consider this:
      </p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  int counter = 1;
  while (counter &gt; 0) {     
    counter ++;
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Here, c<i>ounter</i> starts off as 1, so the loop will run. Then, it
      will increase to 2. Since it is still greater than 0, the loop will run
      again. This particular loop will run forever, since <i>counter</i> can
      never become less than 1, and your game will grind to a halt.<h3><br>
      Multiple conditions
      </h3>
      <p>On several occasions, you don't just want to decide what to do based on
      one variable - there may be a combination of things you want to consider.<br>
      For example, suppose that you want to display a message if the player has <b>two</b>
      specific inventory items. Using your knowledge so far, you could do
      this:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  if (player.inv[5] == 1) {
    if (player.inv[6] == 1) {   
      Display (&quot;You have both the items!&quot;);     
    }
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>However, this is quite unwieldy and if you have a lot of conditions it
      will look rather messy. So, AGS lets you do it this way:
      </p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  if ((player.inv[5] == 1) &amp;&amp; (player.inv[6] == 1)) {   
    Display (&quot;You have both the items!&quot;);     
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This makes use of the <b>&amp;&amp;</b> operator. Note that you need an
      extra pair of outer parenthesis, to contain the whole expression. Each
      part of the expression goes inside parenthesis, as normal, and they are
      joined with the &amp;&amp; symbol.<p>You can extend this to as many checks
      as you like. For example, this will display the message if GlobalInt 1
      currently contains the value 3, and the script variable <i>timer</i> is
      between 5 and 10.
      </p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  if ((GetGlobalInt(1) == 3) &amp;&amp; (timer &gt; 5) &amp;&amp; (timer &lt; 10)) { 
    Display (&quot;It's all working out fine.&quot;);     
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><b>'OR' expressions</b>
      <p>Sometimes you will want to do some processing if one <b>or</b> another
      condition is true. For example, you might want to let the player open a
      door if he has either the door key or a chainsaw.</p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  if ((player.inv[12] == 1) || (player.inv[16] == 1)) {   
    NewRoom (10); 
  }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The operator here is the double-vertical-bar&nbsp; <b>||</b>&nbsp;
      operator. It works similarly to the &amp;&amp; operator, but it will
      process the commands inside it if either one expression, or the other, or
      both, are true.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><br>
      Doing one thing or another</h3>

      <p>Sometimes, you want the script to take one course of action if a
      variable is set, and another course of action if it isn't. The primitive
      way would be to do this:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> if (GetGlobalInt(1) == 5) {    
   // do something
 }
 if (GetGlobalInt(1) != 5) {
   // do something else
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>However, there is a neater way, using the <b>else</b> keyword:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> if (GetGlobalInt(1) == 5) {    
   // do something
 }
 else {
   // do something else
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This also allows you to modify the globalint inside the first block of
      code, without affecting whether the second block gets run or not.</p>

      <p>You can do as many tests as you like, using the <b>else if</b> keyword.
      So, a complete piece of code could look like this:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> if (GetGlobalInt(1) == 5) {    
   // do something
 }
 else if (GetGlobalInt(1) == 6) {   
   // do something different
 }
 else {
   // do this if it's not 5 or 6    
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3><br>
      Your Own Functions</h3>

      <p>You've probably noticed in the manual, it mentioning functions such as <i>dialog_request</i>,
      and <i>on_event</i>, and how you can add them to your global script to do
      cool stuff. But you may be wondering, how exactly to go about it.</p>

      <p>Remember in tutorial 1, we learnt about function <b>parameters</b> and
      how they could be <i>int</i>, <i>string</i>, etc. Well, you write your own
      functions like this:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> function dialog_request (int param) {    
   // contents of function go here
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>You start with the keyword <i>function</i>, then follow it by the
      function name, and then parenthesis listing the parameter types and names.
      For each parameter that you want, you need to write its type (<i>int</i>
      or <i>string</i>), followed by the name it will be known by inside the
      function. This name can be anything you like - it is similar to naming a
      variable.</p>

      <p>There are some <b>fixed</b> functions, such as dialog_request and
      on_event, which are part of AGS and therefore you <b>MUST</b> use the
      correct number and type of parameters.&nbsp; However, you may also add
      your own functions by naming them however you like, and having as many
      parameters as you need.</p>

      <p>Functions are useful if you have a block of script code that you need
      to use in two different places - putting it in a function instead means
      you don't have to copy &amp; paste, and that if you modify it, all other
      script that relies on it gets updated too.</p>

      <p>To call your function from elsewhere in the script, just do it exactly
      like you call a built-in function - ie. just write its name, parameters
      then a semicolon.</p>

      <p>I think a couple of examples are in order. First of all, let's show a
      fixed function, on_event:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> function on_event (int event, int data) {    
   if (event == GOT_SCORE) {
     if (data == 5) {
       PlaySound (1);
     }
     Display(&quot;You just got %d points!&quot;, data);   
   }
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>With this script, whenever the player scores points, they will get a
      message telling them so. Also, if they happen to get 5 points at once, it
      will play sound effect 1.</p>

      <p>As you can see, you use the function parameters just like any other
      script variables.</p>

      <p><b>Our own function</b></p>

      <p>Now, suppose we have a special animation of the player doing a dance,
      and we want to be able to play it from various points in the script. By
      far the easiest way to do this would be to put it in a function:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> function do_dance () {    
   SetCharacterView (EGO, 10);    
   AnimateCharacter (EGO, 2, 5, 0);   
   while (character[EGO].animating) {   
     Wait (1);
   }
   ReleaseCharacterView (EGO);
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This function runs view 10, loop 2, as the character's animation, waits
      until it finishes and then reverts to the default view.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This also illustrates an important point about <i>while</i> loops - if
      you are waiting for a variable to update, you need to call&nbsp;
      Wait(1);&nbsp; which transfers processing back to the engine so that it
      can update all the relevant structures.</p>

      <p><i>TIP</i>: if you're wondering where to place your functions, just
      open up the global script (Game menu, Edit Global Script) and write them
      in there. The function must be outside all other functions.</p>

      <p>Now, in the rest of your script, when you want the player to dance,
      just do:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  do_dance ();    </pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><b>Returning a value</b></p>

      <p>You may have noticed that some of the built-in functions, such as
      GetPlayerCharacter, return a value to the script. You can do this from
      your own functions, using the <b>return</b> keyword. So:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre> function add (int a, int b) {    
   int result;
   result = a + b;
   return result;
 }</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This function adds the two numbers together and returns the result (a
      useless function in practice since the + operator does the same thing, but it
      demonstrates the point).<br>
      Another part of your script could then do:&nbsp;</p>

      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#99CCFF">
            <pre>  total = add (5, 10);    </pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>for example.</p>

      <p><b>Using functions from room scripts</b></p>

      <p>You may notice that when you add your own function to your global
      script, you can call it fine from other places in the global script but
      attempting to use it in a room script gives a parse error. The manual
      explains how to solve this using the script header.</p>

      <h3><br>
      Conclusions</h3>

      <p>We've covered some of the more advanced topics of scripting. I'm sure
      there's a lot of stuff I've forgotten to mention, so feel free to comment
      on it on the forums.&nbsp;</p>

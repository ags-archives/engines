      Getting Started with AGS - Part 4</b></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>Objects are images on the screen which, unlike the screen background,
      can move, change and disappear. You use objects for things in the room
      that the player can take (since they can disappear), and for things which
      need to animate.</p>
      <p>So, let's revisit the age-old &quot;key&quot; inventory item. Let's say
      we've got a locked door, and the player can pick up a key from another
      room to open it with. Please don't use this puzzle when you're making a
      proper game, it's been done far too many times ;-)&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Go to the <i>Objects</i> pane under the Room Editor. Click the
      &quot;New object&quot; button at the top of the screen. Nothing will seem
      to happen, but you now click on the background image, and a new object
      will be placed there as a blue cup. Don't worry if you don't put it in the
      right place, you can move it later.</p>
      <p>The first thing we need to do is to change how it looks. That blue cup
      we can see is the default sprite in AGS, and will appear anywhere that you
      haven't chosen a replacement for. Click the &quot;Change image&quot;
      button in the top part of the screen.</p>
      <p>The screen will now change to present you with the <i>Sprite Manager</i>.
      We'll explain this in more detail later, but basically it is the focal
      point of AGS where you import and export all the graphics (except room
      backgrounds). You should see a small key picture as sprite number 2.
      Double-click that for now, we'll import our own graphics later.</p>
      <p>You should now be returned to the Objects pane, and see that the blue
      cup has changed into a key. You can move it around by left-clicking and
      dragging the sprite within the background image. Place it somewhere
      sensible on your screen. Also, notice in the top part of the editor is an
      &quot;Object name&quot; box. This allows to to name the item, similar to
      the Hotspot Name box for hotspots.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro4_1.jpg" width="503" height="340"><br>
      <i>I've placed the key cunningly in the middle of the walkway ;-)</i></p>
      <p>Before we enable the key to be taken by the player, let me quickly go
      over the other options on this screen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lock this object in position</b> - sometimes, you might have two
          objects that are overlapping each other. In this case, you can lock
          one of the objects, which prevents it from being selected and dragged.
          The Lock setting is only temporary and is not saved in your game
          files, as it's only needed briefly in order to get at an object that's
          stuck behind another.</li>
        <li><b>Set baseline</b> - normally, the baseline for an object is set to
          the bottom of the object graphic (baselines are used to calculate
          which items on the screen are drawn in front and which are drawn at
          the back). However, in some cases you might want to override this.<br>
          What you'll notice with our key is that if the player walks just
          behind it, the key will appear in front of his feet. This is not what
          we want, since the key is supposed to be lying flat on the ground. To
          correct this, click Set Baseline, then click near the top of the room
          image. A blue line will be drawn across. This will make sure that the
          player is always drawn in front of the key.</li>
        <li><b>Object is initially visible </b>- this toggles whether the object
          is switched on at the beginning of the game or not. For our key we
          want it checked, but sometimes you'll have objects which you don't
          want the player to see until they've done something else in the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>The game speed is directly related to the number and size of
            objects on-screen. AGS imposes a limit of 10 objects per room, but
            even if you use all of these and have them visible at the same time,
            the game speed could suffer.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Right, now back to the pressing matter at hand - letting the player
      pick up the key.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Inventory</h3>
      <p>Now wait, there's one more step we need to do first. At the moment we
      could let the player pick up the key, but then what would happen to it?
      Where would it go? We need to define the player's <i>inventory</i>.</p>
      <p>Click on the <i>&quot;Inventory Items&quot;</i> mode in the left-hand
      tree. You will see that there are already two items defined -
      &quot;Key&quot; and &quot;Pink poster&quot;. These are just defaults to
      help you get started. Select &quot;1: Key&quot; in the list. You should
      see the key image appear on the right. But that's a bit small for an
      inventory item, I'm sure I saw something better in the sprite list
      earlier.</p>
      <p>Click the &quot;Change image&quot; button below the key, and the sprite
      manager re-appears. Scroll down to sprite number 19, and you should see
      that it's a much larger picture of a key. Let's use that as our inventory
      icon. Double-click the sprite to select it.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro4_2.jpg" width="503" height="340"><br>
      <i>Yay, we've got a big inventory icon for the key</i></p>
      <p>Ok, there are a few other settings on this screen, but let's return to
      our objective - letting the player pick up the key. Note that the
      inventory item number of the key here is 1, as we will need it later.</p>
      <h4>Back to the interactions</h4>
      <p>Go back to the <i>Objects</i> pane of the Room Editor, and click on,
      yes you've guessed it, the <i>Interaction</i> button. We see our old
      friend, the Interaction Editor, once again. The events here are very
      similar to the ones we had for the hotspot.</p>
      <p>Notice there are two possibilities - &quot;Interact object&quot; and
      &quot;Pick up object&quot;. We actually want to use the &quot;Interact
      object&quot; event, because we are using the default Sierra-style
      interface which doesn't have a specific Pick Up mode. The &quot;Pick
      up&quot;, &quot;Usermode1&quot; and &quot;Usermode2&quot; events are
      useful if you go for a lucasarts-style interface which has more verb types
      available to the player.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So, double-click on &quot;Interact object&quot;. Now, when the player
      picks it up we want two things to happen - firstly, the object on-screen
      needs to disappear, and secondly, the inventory item needs to be added to
      the player's inventory.</p>
      <p>See if you can guess which commands we'll need from the listbox. As a
      clue, we are removing object number 0 from the room, and adding inventory
      item number 1 to the player's inventory.</p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>Remember, to add more than one command to an event, right-click
            the event and choose &quot;New action...&quot;.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Ok, well here's my solution. As an added bonus, I've also given the
      player 5 points for their trouble, but you don't need to have that third
      command:</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro4_3.jpg" width="480" height="360"><br>
      <i>I've added the two commands we need (and one we don't)</i></p>
      <p>Note that our solution is not perfect - the player can click the hand
      icon on the key from anywhere in the room and it will disappear. We are
      also not displaying a message informing the player of what happened. But,
      the functionality is there, and this will do fine for now.</p>
      <p>Okey, so we now have a fully-working first room. Save and test the game
      as before, and try it out. Once the player has taken the key, call up his
      inventory and you should see the large key picture there.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro4_4.jpg" width="326" height="225"><br>
      <i>Roger stands contemplating the key<br>
      </i></p>
      <h3>Room Settings</h3>
      <p>Finally, let's just quickly go over the available settings on the
      Settings pane:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Play music on room load</b> - if set, you can type a music number
          in the box and that background music will start playing when the
          player enters the room. For more about music and sound, see later in
          the manual.</li>
        <li><b>Save/load disabled </b>- if checked, then if the player tries to
          save or load the game while in this room, global message 983
          (&quot;Sorry, not now&quot;) is displayed instead. Global messages are
          described later.</li>
        <li><b>Hide player character </b>- if checked, the player character will
          not be visible in this room, and the Walk mode will be disabled.
          Useful for close-up displays of control panels and so forth.</li>
        <li><b>Player character view </b>- you can type a number in here to
          override the player character's graphic for this room. For example, if
          you have an overhead map screen, you will probably want a different
          image of the character from an overhead perspective.</li>
        <li><b>Music volume adjustment</b> - this allows you to modify the
          background music volume for this screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is the end of the HTML tutorial for now.
      Please continue with the &quot;Setting up the game&quot; part of the main
      manual.

<H3>Character scaling</H3>
AGS supports scaling of characters, where the character can appear to get
smaller as he walks away from the screen. Character scaling is supported as
part of the walkable areas in a room.<P>
The reason why you have multiple colours available for the walkable areas is
because you can set a zoom level for each colour, which defines how large
the character will be while he is in that area. The default for all walkable
areas is <TT>100%</TT>, ie. full size. However, you can adjust it using the "Walkable
Areas" mode to anywhere from <TT>10%</TT> (one-tenth size) to <TT>200%</TT> (double size).<P>
The scaling settings effect all CHARACTERS in the game, but not objects. You
can disable the scaling for an individual character by checking the "ignore
scaling" box in that character's properties.<P>
If you check the "Use continuous scaling" box, then rather than just specifying a
zoom level for the whole walkable area, you specify a min and max zoom level. These
specify the scaling at the top and bottom of the walkable area. When the game is run,
AGS will interpolate these values to make the character smoothly scale down from 
one value to another as he walks towards the back or front of the screen.<P>

<H3>Scrolling</H3>
If you've been wondering, I'll tell you now: Yes, you can create scrolling
rooms, like the ones used in Lucasarts games like Monkey Island (tm) and Day
of the Tentacle.<P>
To create a scrolling room, just import a scene that is larger than 320x200.
For example, 500x200 is a good size for Lucasarts-type rooms.
When you import the scene, a message box will appear asking you what
resolution the picture is drawn for - this is because the picture could
either be a scrolling room at 320x200, or a single non-scrolling screen at
640x400. So,  with a 500x200 room you would click the "320x200" option.<P>
That's all you have to do. Draw on the walkable areas, hotspots and so on, as
normal, and then save the room. The screen will follow the main character
around.<P>
<I>TIP: You can also have scrolling hi-res rooms. Just import a scene which is
larger than 640x400.</I><P>

<H3>Importing a file as the walkable area mask</H3>
AGS has the ability to import an external BMP or PCX file to use as the
walkable-area, hotspot or walk-behind area mask. If you don't like the way
you have to draw these in the editor itsself, you can draw them in another
program and then import them. This is also useful if you are converting a
game you were making with another game-creation system into AGS.<P>
To use the feature, click the "Import Mask" button in the relevant mode of
the Areas editor. There are some restrictions to how this file must be drawn:
it must be the exact same size as the background scene, and it must be in
16-colour (4-bit) or 256-colour (8-bit). Then, colour 0 on the bitmap
signifies transparency and colours 1-15 are used as the
respective hotspot/walk-behind/walkable area numbers. <P>
<B>NOTE:</B> For hotspots and walkable areas, the mask must be the same size as the
background, but at 320x200 resolution. So, if you had a normal sized 640x400 room,
the mask should be 320x200. For walk-behind areas, the mask is the exact same size
as the background image.<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> Do NOT use any colour numbers above 15 on the mask bitmap. Use only
palette indexes 0 to 15.<P>

<H3>Animating background scenes</H3>
If you want to have a lot of animation on the screen, you will come across
two problems if you try to do it using objects:
<UL>

<LI> There is a limit of 15 objects per screen, so you may not be able to
animate everything that you want to.
<LI> Objects slow down the game - the more objects on the screen, the slower
the game runs.
</UL>

The solution to these problems is to use an animating background scene.<P>
How it works is this: Each room can have from 1 to 5 backgrounds. Normally,
each room just has one background. However, you can import up to four extra
backgrounds in each room, and if you do so then the game will cycle through
them, giving the effect of animation.<P>
This gives two main advantages - you can animate the entire screen, and due
to the way the engine works, it doesn't slow down the game at all.<P>
To import a second background for a room, load the room into the editor, then
go to the Room Settings pane, and click the "Animating Backgrounds" button. A
screen appears, which lists the current backgrounds for the room. To import
a new background, click "New frame". To delete a background, click
the "Delete" button on the relevant row. That's all there is to it. To leave the
background editor, click OK.<P>
You can adjust the speed of the animation by changing the "Animation delay" textbox.
Smaller number means faster animation, and the default is 5.<P>
<I>NOTE: All the background scenes must be the same size.<P>
NOTE: (256-colour only) The backgrounds frames each have their own palette (unless
you select "Share palette with main background" before importing). This means
that when the current frame switches in-game, the palette will get reset - therefore
you can't use special palette effects such as CyclePalette or SetPalRGB on screens
with animating backgrounds.</I><P>

<H3>Lighting effects</H3>
You can control the brightness of your characters, courtesy of the "Light levels" option
in the Region settings (under Areas in the editor).<P>
By default this is <TT>100%</TT>, but you can change it from <TT>0% to 200%</TT>.
This number is the light level in the current walkable area. Smaller
numbers are darker, so that <TT>0%</TT> is pitch black and <TT>200%</TT> is very bright.<P>
This feature could be useful if, for example, you have a street lamp on your scene so
when the character walks under it they get brighter, or if a wall is shading
the character from the light they can get darker.<P>
You can alternatively use a colour tint for the region. If you select this, then you
can enter Red, Green and Blue values as numbers from 0-255, which reflect the colour
you want the area to be tinted to. The Amount setting determines to what extent
characters will be tinted, and is from 0-100.<P>
<I>NOTE: Light levels only work when the character's graphic is at the same
colour depth as the background (ie. a 256-colour character in a hi-colour
game won't get lightened).<P>
NOTE: In a 256-colour game, only darkening areas (light level &lt; <TT>100%</TT>) will work.
Also, depending on the room palette the quality of the darkening will vary
in 256-colour games.<P>
NOTE: Light levels affect characters only - they do not affect objects,
overlays or the background scene.</I><P>

<H3>Exact palette import</H3>
If you have drawn a 256-colour background scene which you want to do palette
effects with (for example using the CyclePalette text script function), you
may find that the editor remaps the colours to different slots making it
difficult to do these effects.<P>
To counteract this, AGS now has an "Exact pal import" feature, which
will simply take the palette slots as they are from the source image and
replace the corresponding background slots with them in the room. This means
that your colours will be in the exact slots that you put them in, but you
must make sure that the scene only uses the palette slots that you have
allocated to the background in the Palette editor.<P>
To import a background using Exact Pal Import, just choose the "Import background (exact
pal)" option instead of the normal Import Background option.<P>

      Getting Started with AGS - Part 2</b></h2>
      <p>Remember, adventure games are made up of several <i>rooms</i>, which
      the player moves between in order to play the game.</p>
      <h3>Creating your first room</h3>
      <p>In the AGS editor, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; option under
      &quot;Room Editor&quot; in the left hand pane. You should see a screen
      similar to the following:</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_1.jpg" width="431" height="278"><br>
      <i>The room editor's main pane</i></p>
      <p>As you have only just loaded the editor, the room here is empty.</p>
      <p>The room editor is made up of three different modes - <i>Settings</i>, <i>Areas
      </i>and <i>Objects</i>.&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <i>Settings</i> pane has the overall room options, such as
          whether the player character is visible or not.</li>
        <li>The <i>Areas</i> pane allows you to set up the various types of area
          within the room, such as where the player can walk and what they can
          interact with.</li>
        <li>The <i>Objects</i> pane allows you to set up objects in the room -
          objects are items which can be switched on and off, and can move
          around the room.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Background</b><p>Now, the first thing you need to do is draw the
      background for the room. Depending on what resolution you want to run the
      game at, you should draw it at either 320x200, 320x240, 640x400 or
      640x480. Also, make sure your image is created at the colour depth that
      you chose earlier for the game.<p>Draw the image in your favourite paint
      package, and once done, save it as a BMP or PCX file. Then, return to the
      AGS Editor, and click the &quot;Import Background&quot; button.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_2.jpg" width="136" height="88"><br>
      <i>The &quot;Import Background&quot; button</i><p>Find the file you just
      created, and click Open. If you get a message asking which resolution the
      image is drawn for, select the appropriate option. (You are asked this
      because a 640x480 image, for example, could either be a full-screen image
      for a 640x480 game, or it could be a scrolling background for a 320x200
      game).&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>You should see the black area in the bottom part of
      the Editor replaced by your image.<p><b>Edges</b><p>You'll see four yellow
      lines drawn across your image in various places. These are the room <i>edges,
      </i>and they define how far the character needs to walk to be considered
      to have left the room. Click and drag them to position them appropriately.
      Bear in mind that it's the character's <b>feet</b> that are compared with
      these lines when positioning.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_3.jpg" width="516" height="286"><br>
      <i>I've lined up </i><i>the top and right edges correctly&nbsp;</i><p>At
      the moment, walking past the edge won't actually cause anything to happen,
      but we'll deal with that later.<p><b>Walkable Areas</b><p>Now, it's vital
      that we define the room's <i>walkable areas</i>. These define where
      characters are allowed to walk within the room. Choose the
      &quot;Areas&quot; mode from the left-hand tree, and then make sure that
      &quot;Walkable areas&quot; is selected in the combobox at the top of the
      pane:<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_4.jpg" width="431" height="269"><br>
      <i>Make sure &quot;Walkable areas&quot; is the current selection</i><p>Now,
      you'll notice there are five buttons along the top of the window, allowing
      you to perform the tasks Line, Freehand, Fill, Wipe Colour and Undo,
      similar to a normal paint program.<p>What we need to do is to fill in the
      areas of the room where the player is allowed to walk. In the game, the
      bottom middle of the character is checked against these areas, so it's
      probably wise not to paint right up to the edge where you want them to go,
      since the character will appear to be further over.<p>The best way to
      start off is with the Line tool. Draw some lines to encompass the area
      that you want to be walkable. Make sure they are all joined up, and then
      choose the Fill tool and click in the middle of the area, and it should be
      filled blue. If the whole screen goes blue, click Undo, then use the Line
      tool to make sure all the edges of the area are connected up, and try
      again.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_5.jpg" width="431" height="269"><br>
      <i>I've drawn a walkable area over the path in the image.</i><p><b>Walk-behind
      areas</b><p>The next job we need to do is to define the walk-behind areas.
      These areas (called &quot;Priorities&quot; by AGI and some other adventure
      game tools) tell the game where the character needs to be drawn behind the
      background. For example, in my example screen here, the player needs to
      walk in from behind the curved wall on the right.<p>Choose
      &quot;Walk-behinds&quot; from the combobox at the top of the screen. Your
      walkable area mask will disappear.<p>Now, we draw on the walk-behind area
      in the same way as we did the walkable area - in fact, all the same
      drawing tools are available. My result looks like this:<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intro2_6.jpg" width="431" height="291"><br>
      <i>The walk-behind area painted over the pillar</i><p>Notice that I
      haven't bothered to make the whole of the pillar a walk-behind from top to
      bottom - using my knowledge of the walkable areas and the height of the
      character, I can just draw a walk-behind in the places where it's possible
      for the character to be.<p>Now that we've done that, there's a very
      important next step in order to make the area work - the <b>baseline</b>.
      The baseline is a horizontal line, which tells the game where the
      character has to be in order to be drawn behind the area. For example, if
      you had a table in the middle of the room, you'd only want him drawn
      behind the table if he was standing behind it.<p>You normally place a
      baseline at the lowest point of the walk-behind area. Click the &quot;Set
      Baseline&quot; button, then click at the bottom of your area, and a
      horizontal line will appear there.<p>You may have noticed at the top of
      the window a coloured block with &quot;Editing: 1&quot; written above it.
      By default, you've been drawing blue areas onto the screen. But what if we
      had two pillars, in different places? We wouldn't want the same baseline
      to apply to both. By changing the active colour, you can draw multiple
      areas onto the screen and let them each have their own baseline
      setting.&nbsp;<p><b>Trying out the game</b><p>Ok, we've slogged away at
      making our room - now it's about time to give it a go. The first,
      essential step is to save the room. Choose the &quot;File&quot; menu, then
      &quot;Save Room As...&quot;. In the file selector, type &quot;room1&quot;
      and press OK.<p>AGS uses numbered rooms, from 1 to 300. The filenames of
      these must be &quot;ROOMX.CRM&quot;, where X is the room number. Only
      rooms named this way will be recognised by the game engine.<p>Now, choose
      &quot;Save Game&quot; from the File menu - this saves all your valuable
      work to disk. Next, choose &quot;Setup Game&quot; from the File menu.
      Select the appropriate resolution for your game. Press the
      &quot;Save&quot; button.<p>Finally, it all comes together - select
      &quot;Test Game&quot; from the File menu. Your game should fire up and you
      should see your room with the character in it. Walk around the screen,
      testing out the walkable and walk-behind areas.</p>

            &quot;Starts at X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; boxes. You can find out

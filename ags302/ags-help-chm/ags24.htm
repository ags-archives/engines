<H2>Debugging features</H2>
It happens to the best of us - you're merrily ploughing along making your game, when
suddenly something just isn't working right. It's not always obvious where the problem is.<P>
AGS now has some advanced debugging features that can help you out. If all else fails, you
can of course ask for help on the AGS forums.<P>
Features (2) and (3) below only work when you have the "Debug mode" checkbox ticked on the Game
Settings pane of the editor. So, just before you release your game, untick it and compile
the game again to make sure the player can't cheat using these features.<P>
<B>1. The script debugger</B><P>
When you run the game using the Run (F5) option, the game will be started with the debugger.
This allows you to pause your game and follow it through one line at a time.<P>
There are two main ways to use this feature:<P>
* Press SCROLL LOCK while playing the game. This will break out when the next line of script is run.<P>
* Place a breakpoint in your script. You do this by clicking on a line of code
in the script editor, then pressing F9. Then, when the game arrives at this
line of code, it will stop running. <P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The editor will allow you to place a breakpoint on any line of script.
However, in order for it to work, it must be placed on a line that has some code on it.<P>
Once the script has stopped, you can use the "Step Into" button (F11) to step through
the lines of code, one by one. To allow the game to continue running normally, use the Run (F5) button.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The Script Debugger is not supported on Windows 98 or Windows ME systems.
If you're still using Windows 98, please upgrade to Windows XP or Vista to take advantage
of this feature.<P>
<B>2. The Debug() command</B><P>
There is a scripting command, <A HREF="ags50.htm#Debug">Debug</A>, which you can use in your script
to help you find problems. The default setup enables some hotkeys for the various features -
in particular, Ctrl+X allows you to teleport to another room, Ctrl+A shows the walkable
areas on the screen and Ctrl+S gives you all the inventory items.<P>
You can also use the Debug command to assign a hotkey to toggle FPS display on and off.
(FPS is Frames Per Second, which allows you to see the game speed and spot any slow-running
rooms).<P>
<B>3. Current room information</B><P>
Pressing Ctrl+D displays some information about the current room. It tells you what
room number you are in, followed by the current status of all objects in the room. After that,
another messagebox tells you all the characters that are in the current room and various
information about them.<P>

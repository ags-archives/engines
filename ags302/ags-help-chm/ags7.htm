<H2>Run-time engine setup</H2>
The engine Setup program allows the player to customize certain game settings.<P>
Firstly, they can change the game resolution. If they do so, all your game
graphics will automatically be stretched or shrunk to fit, and the option is a
handy way for the player to start the game if their system won't run at the default
resolution for some reason.<P>
They can also select to run the game in a window on the desktop rather than full-screen.
This will take a performance hit though, so it's always preferable to run full-screen.<P>
The "Use 85 Hz display" option sets the monitor refresh rate to 85 Hz to run the game, which
eliminates flicker. However, this does not work on all monitors, and not at all on flat
panel displays, which is why it is disabled by default.<P>
The "Force alternate letterbox resolution" option is only available for 320x200 and 640x400
modes, and tells AGS to actually run at 320x240 or 640x480 instead, with black 'letterbox'
borders at the top and bottom of the screen. This is useful because some computers no longer
support the 320x200 or 640x400 resolutions, but do support the letterboxed versions.<P>
"Smooth scaled sprites" will apply anti-aliasing to scaled characters, in order to
give a smoother look to the resizing. This can slow down the game though, so it is off
by default.<P>
Finally, the "Downgrade 32-bit graphics to 16-bit" option is only available for 32-bit games.
It allows people with slower PCs to choose to play the game at 16-bit instead, in order
to boost performance. If they use this, the graphical quality will reduce, but it should at
least allow them to play the game at a decent speed.<P>

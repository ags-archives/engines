      <h2 align="center"><b>Getting Started with AGS - Part 3</b></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Adding some interaction</h3>
      <p>Ok, so we now have a working room. The player can walk around it as
      much as they like. However, our game so far is pretty boring - the player
      can't actually do anything of value yet!</p>
      <p>AGS provides you with three types of things that the player can
      interact with - <i>hotspots</i>, <i>objects</i> and <i>characters</i>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>hotspot</b> is an area of the background image that the player
          can look at, interact with, and so forth. Hotspots are generally used
          for parts of the screen such as a tree or the grass, which won't
          change as the game progresses.</li>
        <li>An <b>object</b> is an item in the room that can move around the
          screen, and be switched on and off at will. Objects must stay within
          the room that they are created in.</li>
        <li>A <b>character</b> is like an object, except that it can move
          between rooms and therefore appear all over the game. Characters also
          have special properties such as talking animations and so forth, which
          means you will usually use one to represent each NPC (non-player
          character) in the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Hotspots</h4>
      <p>The easiest thing to start off with is hotspots. Go to the
      &quot;Areas&quot; pane under the Room Editor, and select
      &quot;Hotspots&quot; from the drop-down list box.</p>
      <p>Hotspots are drawn in exactly the same way as walk-behind and walkable
      areas. This time though, the different colours that are available for
      drawing, with each representing a different hotspot. That is, if the player
      clicks a dark blue area of the screen (Hotspot 1), then Hotspot 1's 
		interactions will be triggered. If they click a green area, a different response will happen,
      and so forth.</p>
      <p>You can use the same colour in two different areas of the screen if
      they represent the same thing - for example, you could use colour 1 for
      two different trees, as long as you want a common response for clicking on
      both of them.</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3_1.jpg" width="447" height="316"><br>
      <i>I've drawn four types of hotspot onto my screen</i></p>
      <p>Once you've drawn a hotspot, there are two other fields to set:</p>
		<ul dir="ltr">
			<li dir="ltr">
			<p dir="ltr"><i>The hotspot's name</i>. This sets a player-friendly 
			name for the hotspot, which is vital if you are going to use a Lucasarts-style
      interface where the player can move the mouse over the screen to see
      what's where. If you're using a Sierra-style interface then this name will 
			never be displayed to the player, but it's useful to fill it in 
			anyway for your own benefit.</p></li>
			<li dir="ltr">
			<p dir="ltr"><i>The Script O-Name:</i> This is a name by which the 
			hotspot can be referred to from the room script. This name cannot 
			have any spaces or special characters -- just the letters <i>a</i> 
			to <i>z</i>. You'll notice that an &quot;h&quot; is automatically prepended to 
			the start of the name, so if you call it &quot;Door&quot; then in the script 
			it will be available as &quot;hDoor&quot; (The <i>h</i> means &quot;hotspot&quot;).</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<table border="0" id="table3">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" align="top" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>
			<p dir="ltr">In the Areas editor, all the hotspots except the 
			currently selected one are drawn in grey. This is to emphasise which 
			hotspot you have selected to edit.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h4>Interactions</h4>
      <p>Right, now it's time to make something happen! Make sure the first
      hotspot is selected (it should read &quot;Editing: 1&quot;), and click the
      &quot;Interaction...&quot; button. You should be presented with a window
      that looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3_2.jpg" width="360" height="270"><br>
      <i>The interaction editor</i></p>
      <p>This is the Interaction Editor, and you will become very familiar with
      this window during your AGS development.</p>
      <p>You should see a list of <i>events</i>, from &quot;Player stands on
      hotspot&quot; at the top down to &quot;Usermode2 hotspot&quot; at the
      bottom. The events are represented by flag icons.</p>
      <p>These events show you all the possible things that can happen to this
      hotspot during the game. At the moment, nothing is set to happen in
      response to any of the events, so whatever the player does to the hotspot,
      they will get no reply.</p>
      <p>Right, let's start with something simple. When the player looks at my
      hotspot, I want to display a message telling them what they can see. So,
      double-click the &quot;Look at hotspot&quot; event, and a new window
      should pop-up:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3_3.jpg" width="240" height="225"><br>
      <i>The action editor</i></p>
      <p>You'll see that this new window is quite plain and empty at the moment.
      The most important thing is the large drop-down list box near the top of
      the window, which currently says &quot;Do nothing&quot;. This box is where
      you set what you want the game to do when the player looks at the hotspot.</p>
      <p>Open up the combobox, and you'll see quite an extensive list of options
      - but don't worry, they're in alphabetical order! Scroll down and select
      &quot;Game - Display a message&quot;. The rest of the window is updated
      with information related to this command:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3_4.jpg" width="280" height="263"><br>
      <i>The action editor with &quot;Display message&quot; selected</i></p>
      <p>The text &quot;Message number: 0&quot; is a <i>parameter</i> for the
      command. Different commands have various parameters, and they let you set
      specific information for this use of the command. Here, we are being asked
      which message we want to display. Click the &quot;Change&quot; button if
      you need to change it, but since this will be our first message, number 0
      will be fine.</p>
      <h4>Messages</h4>
      <p>Each room in the game has its own set of messages. A message is simply
      a string of text that can be displayed during the game. To bring up the
      room message editor, there are two options - either click the &quot;Edit
      message&quot; button in the action editor (like we have here), or at other
      times you can use the &quot;Edit messages&quot; button in the Room
      Settings pane.</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3_5.jpg" width="300" height="229"><br>
      <i>The room message editor</i></p>
      <p>Click the &quot;New message&quot; button in the bottom left. A new item
      should be added to the left hand list box, and the cursor is placed in the
      text box on the right.</p>
      <p>Simply type your message into the text box. The &quot;Display message
      as&quot; box allows you to have one of the characters saying the text if
      you want, otherwise leave it as &quot;Normal text&quot; to use the
      standard message box.</p>
      <p>Once you're done typing the message in, press OK.</p>
      <p>You should be back at the Action Editor now. We've set it all up
      correctly to display the message when the player looks at the hotspot, so
      click OK to exit this dialog box. You should notice that a new tree node
      &quot;Game - Display a message (0)&quot; has appeared in the main
      interaction editor under Look at Hotspot. The (0) shows you at a glance
      the values of the parameters to the command.</p>
      <p>You can add as many commands as you like to be run when an event
      happens. But now, since double-clicking collapses the tree, you need to
      right-click on &quot;Look at hotspot&quot; and select &quot;New
      action&quot; instead. However, let's not worry about that for now. Click
      &quot;Close&quot; to exit the interaction editor.</p>
      <h4>Walk-to points</h4>
      <p>Ok, since we're back at the Areas screen, let me quickly explain the
      &quot;Set walk-to point&quot; button. This allows you to set a position
      for each hotspot where the character will walk to whenever the player
      interacts with the hotspot - just like the way the Lucasarts games like
      Monkey Island (tm) worked.</p>
      <p>If you set a walk-to point, then whenever the player clicks interact or
      talk on the hotspot, the main character will first walk to that point
      before the relevant event is triggered. If you want, the man can also walk
      there when the LOOK mode is used - this option is configurable in the game
      General Settings pane.</p>
      <p>To remove a walk-to point, select the appropriate hotspot and click the
      &quot;Remove walk-to point&quot; button.</p>
      <h4>Edges revisited</h4>
      <p>Ok, so we've covered the basics of creating a room. However, there's
      one thing that we did way back in the tutorial that we need to clear up -
      yes, the edges.</p>
      <p>Go to the &quot;Settings&quot; mode under the Room Editor. If you 
		select the &quot;Interactions&quot; option from the Room menu, the Interaction Editor will appear, but this
      time with a different set of events.</p>
      <p>Among the events listed, you'll see &quot;Walk off left edge&quot;,
      &quot;Walk off right edge&quot;, and so on. These use the edges we defined
      back in part 2. A common command to use in response to these events is the
      &quot;Player - Go to a different room&quot; command.</p>
      <p>Now, save the room and the game, then choose File, Test Game to test
      out your room like we did before.</p>

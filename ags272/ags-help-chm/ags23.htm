<H2>Debugging features</H2>
It happens to the best of us - you're merrily ploughing along making your game, when
suddenly something just isn't working right. It's not always obvious where the problem is.<P>
AGS provides a few tools to try and help you deal with these sorts of issues. Depending on
the type of problem you are having, one of the following may help. If all else fails, you
can of course ask for help on the AGS forums.<P>
All of the below only work when you have the "Debug mode" checkbox ticked on the Game
Settings pane of the editor. So, just before you release your game, untick it and compile
the game again to make sure the player can't cheat using these features.<P>
<B>1. The Debug() command</B><P>
There is a scripting command, <A HREF="ags41.htm#Debug">Debug</A>, which you can use in your script
to help you find problems. The default setup enables some hotkeys for the various features -
in particular, Ctrl+X allows you to teleport to another room, Ctrl+A shows the walkable
areas on the screen and Ctrl+S gives you all the inventory items.<P>
You can also use the Debug command to assign a hotkey to toggle FPS display on and off.
(FPS is Frames Per Second, which allows you to see the game speed and spot any slow-running
rooms).<P>
<B>2. Current room information</B><P>
Pressing Ctrl+D displays some information about the current room. It tells you what
room number you are in, followed by the current status of all objects in the room. After that,
another messagebox tells you all the characters that are in the current room and various
information about them.<P>
<B>3. Debug console (unofficial feature)</B><P>
Pressing the <TT>`</TT> key (same as for the Quake console, generally to the left of the 1 key on
the keyboard) brings up the debug console. This displays various messages telling you what
is happening in the game - for example, "EGO starting walk to (X, Y)" and so forth. Not all
game events are displayed here - if there's something useful you wish was displayed, say so
on the AGS Technical Forum and it can be added.<P>
<B>4. Script line information (unofficial feature)</B><P>
Press Scroll Lock to bring up the Script Line window. This appears in the top right of the
screen and tells you what script line number is currently being run. It significantly slows
down your game because the screen has to be updated so regularly.<P>
The information here tends to whizz by too quickly in normal game play. But during a cutscene
or Wait() script, it is useful for seeing what is happening at the time, or for spotting
where the script has gone wrong.<P>
While this window is displayed, you can hold Right-Shift to pause it so you can actually
read what it says - release Right Shift to continue the game.<P>
If you press Left Shift, the game will be locked into a step-by-step mode, where you must
press Left Shift every time to continue onto the next script line. Right Shift exits this
mode.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Features 3 and 4 are unofficial - that is, support and help will not be offered
on the AGS forums. If they work, great - if not, sorry but too bad.<P>

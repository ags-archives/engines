<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<P>
<B>Q. Can I play an AVI file?</B><P>
A. Yes, with the PlayVideo function in hi-color games.
   For 256-colour games, however, the FLC format is more appropriate.
   To split an AVI file into WAV and FLC components, I recommend the excellent
   Smacker tools (www.smacker.com) which are free to download and also do
   a VERY good job of reducing true-color AVIs down to 256-colours.<P>
<B>Q. Why is AGS so slow compared to the original Sierra/Lucasarts games? I
   could run Space Quest 3 on my 286, but AGS needs 32 Mb RAM????</B><P>
A. There are several reasons why AGS is not as fast, and more resource
   hungry than the original games. First of all, AGS is not optimised for
   speed, I admit that. Luckily however, most people these days have at
   least a Pentium-class system so that's no big problem.
   Second, consider that AGS supports up to 640x480 hi-colour resolution,
   whereas the original Sierra/LEC games only did 320x200x256.
   
   Thirdly, the Sierra/LEC systems were entirely script-based - that is, the
   programmers created the game without any features like interaction lists,
   GUI editors and Dialog editors. These features, while making AGS a lot
   easier to use, also have their toll on memory and processor usage. If I
   was to convert AGS to a script-only system, it would probably only need
   a fraction of the system resources. But would you use it then?
   
   Finally, yes I could spend a month or so optimising the engine to be as
   fast as possible. However, you the users have made it clear that you
   prefer new features and bug fixes to speed improvements, so that's what
   I'm trying to give you.
   At time of writing this (December 2000), a mid-range new PC is 750 MHz,
   with most people currently using around a 450 MHz system. Therefore, I am
   not going to spend a lot of time doing speed improvements just so it'll run
   on your 486. Sorry, but that's the way it is.<P>
<B>Q. What's the deal with the license? What does it mean in plain English?</B><P>
A. Adventure Game Studio is now pretty much freeware. That means you may use
   it freely for non-commerical games, and you don't have to send me anything
   in return.
   There is one requirement - if you want to SELL a game you make, for profit,
   then you must contact me beforehand as there are some licensing issues
   which you may need to be aware of.
   When you finish your game, feel free to post it on the AGS Announcements
   forum so that everyone can give it a go.<P>
<B>Q. Why the swapware license? Why aren't you charging for it?</B><P>
A. Because I want to. Mainly because if you see a program claiming to create
   adventure games, but charging you a registration of 100 if you want to
   distribute a game, you're not likely even to try it. A few people are doing
   this, for example Twilight Software with their system, but at 40 for a
   single user registration, just to make freeware games with it, that's a sure
   way to make it unpopular. Remember "Klik'n'play"? Hmmm.....<P>

<H2>The demo game</H2>
The first thing you'll probably want to do is to run the demo game. This
game will try to show you some of what AGS can do.<P>
To run the demo, you'll need to load it into the editor and then use the Test Game
feature (a precompiled version is not included, to save disk space).<P>
<B>NOTE: The demo game is currently under development. It has various unfinished
or unimplemented areas.</B><P>
<B>The demo game is available as a separate download from the website, as it can be
updated more or less frequently than AGS itself.</B><P>

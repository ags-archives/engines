If you have any comments or suggestions, the first place to go is the AGS
Forums. Linked off the main AGS website, it's where the AGS community
meets and you will find answers to many questions there.<P>
If you think you've found a bug, if you need help or can't get it to work,
please check the following:<UL>

<LI> That your question is not already answered in this manual. AGS has been
painstakingly documented, so PLEASE read this manual through before asking
me a question.
<LI> If it is not covered in the manual, check the CHANGES.TXT file. If a new
feature has been added then it will be described there, if it has not yet
been added to this manual.
<LI> That you are using the most recent version of AGS. Use the "Check For
Updates" option on the Help menu to make sure you're up to date.
<LI> If you are receiving an error message, please write down the EXACT message
and any other information which you think is appropriate. PLEASE WRITE THE
EXACT ERROR MESSAGE TEXT, don't just say "I get a message about it not being
able to find a file".
<LI> If you are getting lock-ups or techno-garbage printouts, please try to
give a situation which causes the problem. For instance, if you notice that
it only happens on certain screens, or only if there is an object, etc then
please state that - it makes replying a lot easier and faster.
</UL>

Whatever the problem, if you can't solve it then post to the Technical Forums
for help and include all the details of the problem -- there are lots of
people there who will try to help you out.<P>
Please don't send me e-mail or private messages about problems using AGS.
Post them to the forums, where others can help you and your question will
then be searchable so that people in future can find out the answer without
having to ask again!<P>
<B>IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT e-mail me your game.</B> When you have a demo or
full game to show off, please post it in the appropriate forum.<P>
<I>NOTE:</I> If you want to mail me an attachment to demonstrate a problem you are
having, PLEASE COMPRESS IT using WinZip, PKZIP, etc and send it to me as a
zip file. Also, please get permission in advance before sending me any
attachments, or your message may get automatically deleted.<P>
<B>REMEMBER:</B> When you post a question to the forums, give it at least 24
hours before posting again asking "WHY IS NOBODY HELPING ME?!?!?". We don't
all read the forums 24/7, good things come to those who wait.<P>

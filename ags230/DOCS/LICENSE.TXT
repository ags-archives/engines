GAME DISTRIBUTION
-----------------
If you wish to distribute games created with Adventure Game Studio then you
may do so freely (subject to file restrictions below), UNLESS you are asking
for money for your game; if you ARE selling your game for profit then you may
do so as long as you send a copy of the game to Chris Jones.

WHICH FILES YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE (IMPORTANT):
When you distribute your game, you are allowed to include the following files
from the AGS package:
  * ACDOS.EXE, ACWIN.EXE, or your game's custom EXE.
  * AC2GAME.DAT; only needed if you don't use your custom EXE.
  * The SETUP.BAT file, modified if necessary. Note that this does not work
    with Windows 2000/XP systems so ideally you would create a shortcut
    instead.
  * The CWSDPMI.EXE file, which allows people running plain MS-DOS to play the
    game. Without this file, the game will need to be run from a Windows (tm)
    MS-DOS Prompt. (This file is not needed if you use the Windows engine).
    If you include the CWSDPMI.EXE file, then you MUST acknowledge it in your
    game's documentation file. A line similar to the following will be
    sufficient:
    "Includes CWSDPMI DPMI host, copyright 1997 by Charles Sandmann"
  * The EMU387.DXE file, which allows people with a 386 or 486 SX computer to
    play the game. However, since the game will probably not run well on these
    systems anyway, you may decide not to include this file.
YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY OTHER AGS FILES WITH YOUR GAME. THAT INCLUDES THE
ROOM EDITOR, DOCUMENTATION AND DEMO GAME FILES.


DISTRIBUTING THE AGS PACKAGE
----------------------------
If you wish to distribute Adventure Game Studio itsself, for uploading to FTP
sites, on your web page, giving to a friend, etc, then:

You may distribute Adventure Game Studio ONLY in its original form in the ZIP
file (ags_23.zip). You may NOT modify ANY of the AGS files in ANY way and then
redistribute it.
If you post AGS on a website then you MUST also mention that the latest
version can be obtained from http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk

<H2>Music and sound</H2>
All good games use sound to involve and immerse the player in the game. AGS
allows you to play a background music track, and also to play sound effects
at appropriate times.<P>
For background music, AGS can use OGG, MP3, MIDI, WAV (uncompressed), MOD,
XM, IT and S3M music files. For sound effects, you can use OGG, MP3, WAV and VOC files.<P>
When AGS needs to play music number X, it will search for the files in the
"Music" sub-folder of the game, in the following order. The first file it
finds, it plays: MUSICx.OGG, MUSICx.MP3, MUSICx.WAV, MUSICx,MID, MUSICx.MOD,
MUSICx.XM, MUSICx.S3M, MUSICx.IT<P>
<B>TIP: What is ogg?</B> OGG is a digital music format, similar to MP3, but achieving
better compression and higher quality. More importantly, it is a totally free format
so no royalty payments or licenses are required to use it. For more information and
programs to encode your music to OGG, see http://www.vorbis.org/<P>
When the game loads, music 0 will be played if it exists in the "Music" directory.
You can change the music later by setting "Play music on room load" in a room,
by using the PlayMusic script command, or by using the "Play music" interaction
command.<P>
To play a sound effect during the game, you can use the PlaySound script
command, or the "Play sound" interaction command. The game will search for
SOUNDx.OGG, SOUNDx.MP3, SOUNDx.WAV and SOUNDx.VOC, where X is the sound number.<P>
<B>NOTE</B>: WAV, MP3 and OGG music files are not included in the game EXE, but 
are instead bundled into a separate file called MUSIC.VOX. This means that you
can make it an optional download if you wish; the game will fall back onto MIDI 
versions of the music if this file is not present.<P>

<H3>Voice speech</H3>
With AGS you can link a line of dialog to a speech file, to enable "talkie"-
style games. Suppose you have a dialog script with the following:
<PRE>
ego: "Hi! How are you?"
david: "I'm fine."
</PRE>
Normally this would display the words in the speech text above the characters
heads. However, you can add the special character '&amp;' to symbolise that a
voice file should also be played. The file name is made up of the <B>first four
letters</B> of the character's <B>script name</B>, then an ID number. For example,
<PRE>
ego: &10 "Hi! How are you?"
david: &7 "I'm fine."
</PRE>
This would play EGO10.WAV with the first line, and DAVI7.WAV with the second.
When a line of text has a voice linked to it, the text on the screen will not
be removed until the voice file has finished playing. If the player interrupts
it by clicking the mouse or pressing a key, the text and voice will be stopped.
Voice files must be placed in the "Speech" sub-directory of the game folder.<P>
You can also use speech with Say script function.
<PRE>
cEgo.Say("&10 Hi! How are you?");
cDavid.Say("&7 I'm fine.");
</PRE>
<B>NOTE:</B> WAV, OGG and MP3 format files can be used for speech.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> You cannot use speech file numbers above 9999. That is, you can
have EGO1.OGG all the way up to EGO9999.OGG, but not EGO10000.OGG or higher.<P>
Speech is compiled into a file called SPEECH.VOX and is separate
from the rest of your game data so that you can offer it as an optional extra
download to the player. The game will function correctly if the file is not
present.<P>

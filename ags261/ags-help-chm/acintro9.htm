      Getting Started with AGS - Part 9</b></h2>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>Cursors</h3>
      <p>It's easy to overlook mouse cursors, but they provide the essential 
		interface between the player and the game world. In AGS, each mouse 
		cursor provides a different <i>mode</i> of interaction to the player.</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro9_1.jpg" width="420" height="252"><br>
		<i>The Cursors pane</i></p>
		<p>Unlike most of AGS, mouse cursors modes are not generic - that is, 
		AGS has special coded behaviour for some of the cursors. This means that 
		you are unable to customize what some of the cursor modes do - let's 
		list these ones briefly:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Mode 0 (Walk to)</b> - this will always move the player 
			character to the co-ordinates at which the mouse was clicked</li>
			<li><b>Mode 4 (Use inventory)</b> - AGS will only allow this mode to 
			be selected if the player character has an active inventory item, 
			and it will always invoke the &quot;Use inventory&quot; interaction.</li>
			<li><b>Mode 6 (Pointer)</b> - this is used whenever a normal 
			Windows-style mouse pointer is required. For example, when the user 
			is prompted to select a dialog option; when a popup GUI is 
			displayed, and so forth.</li>
			<li><b>Mode 7 (Wait)</b> - this cursor is shown whenever the player 
			cannot interact with the game world (ie. during a cutscene). It is 
			automatically shown during blocking script functions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All the other cursors are 'normal' cursors, in that you can use them 
		for whatever purposes you want.</p>
      <table border="0" id="table2">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>If you want to create a Lucasarts-style game where the mouse 
			cursor disappears during cutscenes, the easiest way to do it is 
			simply to import a blank image over the Wait mouse cursor.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The Cursors editor pane is fairly self-explanatory. Click the &quot;Change 
		image&quot; button to set a graphic for the cursor; and click inside the 
		graphic to set the cursor's hotspot. (The <i>hotspot</i> sets which spot 
		under the cursor will be activated when you click with it).</p>
		<p>There are a couple of other options you can set for cursors, let's 
		cover them briefly:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Standard Mode</b> tells AGS that this is a normal 
			user-selectable cursor. It is used when cycling through mouse 
			cursors, to determine whether to use the cursor or skip over it. For 
			example, if during the game you disable the current cursor, AGS will 
			change to the next available Standard Mode.</li>
			<li><b>Animate</b> allows you to make an animated mouse cursor. If 
			you check the box, additional options appear allowing you to choose 
			which view to use (loop 0 of the view will be cycled continuously). 
			You can also select &quot;Only when over hotspot or object&quot; to make the 
			cursor only animate while it is over something that the player can 
			interact with; and &quot;Only when the mouse is moving&quot; to do a 
			QFG4-style cursor which only animates while the player is moving it 
			around.</li>
		</ul>
      <table border="0" id="table1">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>You can use the &quot;New Cursor&quot; button to create additional cursors 
			to the standard 10. If you do so however, any extra cursors you 
			create will not have interaction events created for them, so you 
			will have to handle their clicks using the &quot;Any Click&quot; events.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;<h3>Fonts</h3>
		<p>The default blank game comes with a couple of basic fonts, but you 
		don't have to use them - you can import your own.<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro9_2.jpg" width="420" height="264"><br>
		<i>The Font Editor</i><p>By default, you'll see three fonts are 
		available. Font 0 is the standard font used in message boxes. Font 1 is 
		the speech font, used with lucasarts-style speech; and font 2 is an 
		outline font for the speech font.<p>Outlines are pretty much essential 
		for lucasarts-style speech. Since the text is drawn directly onto the 
		screen and not onto a message box, without an outline it could be very 
		hard to read the text, depending on what colour the screen happened to 
		be behind it.<p>There are two ways to do outlines - AGS can do an 
		automatic outline, or you can import a special outline font. They both 
		have advantages:<ul>
		<li>Automatic outlining is easy to use - just check the option, and it 
		works with any font.</li>
		<li>Using an outline font is faster in the game, since it is just drawn 
		once (whereas automatic outlining has to redraw the line of text 8 
		times).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Importing fonts</b><p>AGS supports both TrueType (TTF) and SCI 
		(Sierra's format) fonts. To overwrite an existing font, simply select it 
		and click the &quot;Import font&quot; button. To create a new font slot, click the 
		&quot;New font&quot; button, then &quot;Import font&quot;.<p>You should use SCI fonts 
		wherever possible, since they are significantly faster to render than 
		TTF fonts. Using TTF fonts can slow your game down, so only use them if 
		you really need to.<p>Where can you get a SCI font? Well, there are 
		three ways:<ul>
			<li>Create your own font and save it in SCI Font format, using the
			<a href="http://scigraphicstudio.cjb.net">SCI Graphic Studio program</a>.
			</li>
			<li>Extract the font from a Sierra game, using the SCI Decoder 
			program available on the internet (note however that this will have 
			copyright implications for your game).</li>
			<li>You can get a Sierra SCI Font Pack on the
			<a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/fonts">AGS website</a>.</li>
		</ul>

          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>If you go to your Windows Fonts folder to try and import a TTF 
			font, you will not be able to do so (double-clicking them will open 
			them up in the Windows Font Viewer). Unfortunately there is nothing 
			I can do about this - you must either type the filename in manually, 
			or copy the font to another folder and import it from there.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <table border="0" id="table4">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>By default, font 0 is used as the normal text font, and font 1 is 
			used as the speech font. To use any additional fonts, the text 
			script functions SetNormalFont and SetSpeechFont can be used to 
			change the active fonts.</td>

		<p>That's it for the &quot;Getting Started&quot; tutorials. I hope they've helped 
		you to get a grasp of the AGS basics. If there's anything you didn't 
		really understand or that you think should be covered but wasn't, please 
		let us know on the Beginners Technical Forum, so that the tutorials can 
		be improved to explain it better.<p><a href="acintro.htm">Return to

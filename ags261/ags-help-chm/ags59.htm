Please refer to the online Knowledge Base for a proper list of current
bugs and fixes. It's under the "Support" link on the AGS website. This
section of these docs is very rarely updated.<P>
<B>Q. How do I import this character I downloaded in CHA format?</B><P>
A. In the editor, go to the Characters pane and click the "Import character" button. Simple.<P>
<B>Q. On my screen, I can't move the main character. Wherever I click to move him,
   he just stands there.</B><P>
A. If the main character isn't on a walkable area, he will not be able to move.
   Load the screen into the Room Editor, and check that the location where the
   man is has a walkable area there.<P>
<B>Q. When I enter a certain room, I just get a black screen.</B><P>
A. Make sure that you haven't used a Display Message command in the "Player
   enters screen" event for that room. Remember that this event happens BEFORE
   the screen fades in.<P>
   To make sure, when you get the black screen, try pressing enter, or clicking
   the left mouse button. If nothing happens then something more serious may
   have happened. If this is the case, press Alt+X, which should exit the
   program and give you a list of numbers which you can send to me to
   investigate.<P>
<B>Q. The character isn't drawn behind my walk-behind areas!</B><P>
A. You need to define the base line for the area, or he will always be drawn
   in front. See <A HREF="ags10.htm#Walkbehinds">here</A> for information.<P>
<B>Q. My USERGAME.EXE file seems to have disappeared.</B><P>
A. Because this file is your entire game, including the room files, when you
   save a room in the Room Editor it will delete the exe file (because the
   room contained in the exe is out of date). To get it back, simply save the
   game again by going to the Game, Main tab and choosing the "Save game"
   button.<P>
<B>Q. I get a message "Exiting due to signal SIGxxxx, Shutting down Allegro"
   and it says it "exited without requesting it".</B><P>
A. If you see a list of numbers, each starting with "0x", please write them
   down and contact me. Check that you haven't done anything silly, like used
   a sprite or view number which doesn't exist.<P>

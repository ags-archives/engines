<H2>Distributing your game</H2>
When you choose the "Save game" option in the Editor, as well as
creating data files which it needs for itsself, the program will create an
executable file with the name of your game, in the "Compiled" sub-directory of
your game's folder.  This single file contains all of the program
code and data for your game, and is the file you should distribute.<P>
Copy this EXE file to another directory or drive, or even
another computer, and there you have your game, contained in a single file!
Note, though, that you should also include the WINSETUP.EXE file to allow the
user to run the Setup program.<P>
<I>NOTE: It is not possible to load the exe file back into the Room Editor. This
means two things when only the EXE file is available: (1) other people can't
edit your game's data, and (2) you can't either. Always keep a backup of the
other files produced (*.CRM, AC2GAME.DTA, etc) as they are what the Editor
needs to be able to load your game for editing.</I><P>
<I>TIP:</I> You can make a "Loading..." style splash screen to be displayed while your game starts
up. To do so, simply save the image as  PRELOAD.PCX (must be the same resolution and colour depth
as the game) in the game folder, and save the game. It should then display while the game is loading.<P>
<I>NOTE: Due to the licenses of code used by AGS, your documentation should acknowledge the
following:</I><P>
TrueType font display uses ALFont by Javier Gonzalez and the Freetype project. Distributed
under the terms of the FreeType project license.<P>
OGG player is alogg by Javier Gonzalez, using the Ogg Vorbis decoder, which is available

MP3 player is almp3, by Javier Gonzalez and the FreeAmp team. It uses the mpg123 MP3 decoder,
and is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.<P>
You should also include all the license_* files from the DOCS directory with your game.<P>
<B>IMPORTANT: If you intend to make money for your game, be it shareware or commercial,
it is imperative that you read the Legal Information page on the AGS website, currently
at http://www.agsforums.com/aclegal.htm </B><P>
<I>NOTE: MP3 and OGG music files are not included in the exe. They will instead be
built into a file called MUSIC.VOX when you click the "Rebuild VOX files"
option in the editor. Since OGGs and MP3s override all other music file types, this
allows you to have an Digital Music Pack which you can distribute seperately to
your game. If it is present in the game directory it will be used, otherwise
any other music available (eg. MIDI) will be played instead.</I><P>

<H3>Custom icon</H3>
If you wish, you can use your own custom icon when you build a Windows EXE
file. To do this, simply place your icon in your game's folder, and name
it USER.ICO. Then, load the editor, make sure it is set to generate a Windows
executable, and save the game.<P>
Your icon must be standard 32x32 pixels in 16-colour. If it is any other size
or colour depth, the editor will give an error.<P>
<I>NOTE: The icon <B>must</B> be a proper Windows .ICO file, <B>not</B> just a renamed
BMP file. Icon editors, such as AX-Icons from http://www.axialis.com, will convert
it for you.</I><P>
You can also have a custom icon for the Setup program generated. To do so, create
your icon as above but name it <B>setup.ico</B> in the game folder.<P>

<H3>Splitting resource files</H3>
Some people found that once their game became large, the single EXE file
was slow at changing rooms. AGS now includes an option to split up the
resource files into smaller chunks to avoid this happening. On the
General Settings pane you'll notice a checkbox "Split resource files up into X Mb".
If you tick this, then type in a number such as 1 or 2, then save the game,
the game data will be split up into chunks that size, named GAME.001,
GAME.002 and so on.<P>
Some resources are still combined into the EXE file but
all the rooms will be placed into the other files.
If you use this option, you need to distribute your game's EXE file plus
all the GAME.00? files.<P>

<H3>Advanced information for game distribution</H3>
When you save the game in the editor, it goes through these steps:<P>
1. Compile game into AC2GAME.AGS in game folder, and rooms into GAME.00? files if requested.<P>
2. Combine ACWIN.EXE and AC2GAME.AGS into your custom EXE in the Compiled folder.<P>
Therefore, it is possible to distribute either:<P>
(a) your custom game .EXE file, or<P>
(b) ACWIN.EXE and AC2GAME.AGS<P>
.AGS files are associated with the engine in Explorer, so the user can simply double-click
the .AGS file to run the game. Normally, just distributing your custom EXE will be easier,
but if you want to supply both the DOS and Windows engines, or if your game is made up of
two sub-games, you will save space by using this approach.<P>
If the user doesn't have any AGS games on their system, the .AGS file type will not be
associated with anything. To fix this, your game installation program can run:
<PRE>
ACWIN.EXE -updatereg
</PRE>
which will update the registry with the file association and then quit. Nothing is displayed
on the screen by AGS when you do this.<P>

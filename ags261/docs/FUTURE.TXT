The following features have been requested for future versions of AGS. Generally
speaking, suggestions at the top of the list are higher priority than those at the
bottom of the list.

 * games page - add e-mail addresses, register username to link games together
 * online manual allowing user comments on manual pages
 * games page Keywords to allow a 'similar games' feature
   games page release dates for games
   games page link to forums - each game should have list of contributors as forum names
                               allowing "view my games" link in peoples profiles
 * Add link to Plugins category page to the Resources page

 * editor Script menu, repeatedly_Execute goes to _always because it doesn't check for (

   the bottom of the image while zoomed in - the selection rectangle suddenly jumps
   down
 * with crossfading enabled, if you go from one room to another with a higher volume
   setting, the volume increases while it is fading out

   should not receive input

   NotifySpriteUpdated - use with dynamic sprites to tell it to refresh 
     object/character image cache if they currently use that sprite

 * SetCursorAnimationEnabled  to allow them to disable the animating mouse cursor
 * Display() should support a tab character '\t' to tab to next N pixels
 * NoTranslate function which does nothing but allows to wrap text you don't want

   pause_mod, resume_mod;  GetMODPattern, SeekMODLine(pattern, pos)
   MOD music doesn't save speed & tempo (Seek To Pattern doesn't check previous

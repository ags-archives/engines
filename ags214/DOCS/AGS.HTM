The <b>Adventure Game Studio</b> (or <b><b>AGS</b></b> for short) allows you to create your own
point-and-click adventure games, like the older <a href="http://www.sierra.com"><B>Sierra</b></a>
games (Space Quest IV, King's Quest V-VI, etc). It includes an easy-to-use Integrated Development Environment, and you do not need any programming experience to make a game
using it.<br>
<br>For more advanced users, <B><b>AGS</b></b> supports scripting, where you can write a sort
of program which allows you to have great control over the game.<br>
<br>By default, <B><b>AGS</b></B> will create <b><a href="http://www.sierra.com">Sierra</a></b>-style adventure games, with the pop-up icon bar, and right-click cycles through the modes (walk, look, use, speak).<br>
However, you can change the interface completely using the Interface Editor to make <B><a href="http://www.lucasarts.com">Lucasarts</a></B>-style or any other type of interface you want.<br>
<br><b>AGS</b> handles many parts of the system for you, like load/save game, character
movement and object animations.<br>
<br>
(You may have known this program previously as the <B>Adventure Creator</B>: the last
version was <B>Adventure Creator v1.14</B>. The reasons for the name change are
described in the &quot;<a href="#upgrading">Upgrading from v1</a>&quot; section of this document).
<br><br>
<font color=#0000A0><U><b>Adventure Game Studio SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</B></U></font>
<ul>
<li>486 or higher processor (DX4/100 or better recommended)
<li>VGA display (SVGA optional)
<li>at least 4 Mb RAM, but 8 Mb is recommended
<li>MS-DOS 5.00 or higher (or Windows 95/98).
<li>About 10 Mb free disk space (may need more or less, depending on the game)
<li>Sound card optional (supports Adlib, Sound Blaster and General MIDI for
    music; Sound Blaster and ESS Audiodrive for digital sound).
</ul>
This is the formatted version of the manual. A plain text version is also

<a name="#runtime"></a><font color=#0000a0><b><u>2. USING THE RUN-TIME ENGINE</u></b></font><br><br>
The engine (also called the &quot;interpreter&quot;) is what runs your game and is what
the end player will use. To run the interpreter, type AC and press return.
If you are using the default interface, then you use the right mouse button to
cycle between the available 'modes', and the left button to use the current
mode on the mouse position. You can also move the mouse to the top of the
screen to bring up the icon bar where you can directly select a mode.
<br><br>To exit the engine, press Ctrl-Q. You can save your game position using F5
and restore with F7.
<br><br>The controls described above work with the default setup; however, you can
customize your game to use a different interface and shortcut keys.
<br><BR><BR>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>2.1 THE DEMO GAME</u></b></font><br><br>
The first thing you'll probably want to do is to run the demo game. This
short game (made up of 9 screens) will show you some of what <b>AGS</b> can do. It
doesn't demonstrate all the features, though - you'll find about them for
yourself. To run the demo, type DEMO and press return.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>2.2 RUN-TIME ENGINE SETUP</u></b></font><br><br>
By default, the engine will automatically detect the player's sound card, and
use the low-resolution 320x200 display mode. However, the player can override
the autodetection if it cannot detect their sound card. To run the setup
program, type SETUP and press return.
<br><br>In the Setup program, the user can choose their sound effect card (used for
sound effects like WAVs, and also for MOD and XM music) and their MIDI music
card (used for MIDI music only).
<br><br>They can also choose what screen resolution they would like to run the engine
using. The available choices are 320x200, 640x400 and 960x600. The higher
resolution gives a better quality picture in the game, but slows the game down.
Generally, use the 320x200 mode for computers which are Pentium-100 or slower.
The 640x400 mode is the best choice and will work with Pentium-120 or higher
computers. The 960x600 mode should only be used with very high-spec machines
(ie. Pentium-II and better machines).
<br><br>Note however, that the picture quality is only as good as it was drawn, so if
all the scenes in your game are drawn at 640x400, then using the 960x600
resolution will not help -  it will just slow the game down.
<br><br><br>
<font color="#00a000"><u><b>2.2.1 THE WAVETABLE SYNTH MIDI DRIVER</b></font></u><br><br>
New in v2.02 is a MIDI driver called &quot;Software wavetable synth&quot;. This uses
a MIDI patch set to play MIDI music through the digital sound driver, thus
meaning that the music will sound the same on all sound cards. This is
particularly useful for standard Sound Blaster cards, where the built-in MIDI
chips on the card sound very crappy.
<br><br>This driver is never autodetected; the player must choose it specifically
by running the Setup program. Note that since it uses the digital driver to
play the sound, you must have a digital sound card installed in the system
for it to work. Also note that it will slightly slow down the game over just
using a standard MIDI driver.
<br><br>To use the wavetable driver, you need to get the General MIDI patch set, which
you can download from the <b>AGS</b> website (it's 1.5 Mb, that's why it's only
available seperately). If the patch set is not found in the <b>AGS</b> directory,
then Setup will not allow you to choose the driver.
<br><br><br>
<a name="#tutorial"></a><font color="#0000a0"><b><u>3. TUTORIAL</b></font></u><br><br>
This section will introduce you to the <b>AGS</b> by leading you through how to
create a simple game.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1 CREATING YOUR FIRST ROOM</u></b></font><br><br>
In adventure games, the character moves from one screen to another, and each
screen consists of a pre-rendered background drawing with objects and
characters on top of it to give interaction. A screen is also called a &quot;room&quot;.
First, you need to draw a background scene for the first room. You do this in
your favourite paint program. The size must be either 320x200 or 640x400, and
you must make sure that the colour depth is set to 256-colour (8-bit). Save it
as a BMP or PCX file (TIP: a PCX will give smaller file sizes since PCXs are
compressed, whereas BMPs are not).
<br><br>Load the <b>AGS</b> editor (type ROOMEDIT and press return). It will ask you which
game you want to edit. Highlight &quot;NEW GAME&quot;, then click OK. Here you type the
directory name for the game (up to 8 characters max), and press return. You
have now created a new game.
<br><br>Choose the &quot;ROOM&quot; tab if it is not already displayed (The tabs are the four
buttons along the bottom of the screen). On the left hand side of the screen,
there are five other buttons, called &quot;Setup screen&quot; down to &quot;Objects&quot;. By
clicking one of these, you choose which sub-mode the editor is in.
<br><br><B><font color=#a00000><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font></font></b> Don't let the name &quot;RoomEdit&quot; fool you - it is, in fact, your integrated
environment for development of the whole game, not just the rooms.
<br><br>First of all we need to import a background scene for the room. Click on
&quot;Setup screen&quot; and then choose the &quot;Load scene...&quot; button on the main panel.
You will see a file selector where you should now find the background scene
graphic which you drew. Click OK, and it will be imported.
<br><br>(If you get a message asking you what resolution the picture is drawn for,
choose the appropriate button. For example, if you have drawn a 640x400-sized
scene, then click &quot;640x400&quot;).
<br><br>You will see the top half of the picture, on the screen, along with two scroll
bars which you can use to see the rest of it.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The Editor always runs in the 320x200 graphics mode. If you have drawn
a high-resolution picture at 640x400 it will seem to have been reduced. This
is only in the editor and you will see the proper picture in the actual game.
You can check that it was imported properly by clicking the &quot;Full screen&quot;
button which gives you a preview at the proper resolution.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The Room Editor has on-line context sensitive help (and now with a new
graphical help reader!) Press F1 at any time.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><u><b>3.1.1 WALKABLE AREAS</u></b></font><br><br>
Now that you have the background scene, you need to tell the game where the
player character is allowed to walk. You do this using walkable areas. Choose
the &quot;Walkable areas&quot; mode from the left-hand button list.
<br><br>Everywhere that the character's feet are allowed to walk, you must make
walkable. Adding walkable areas works in a similar way to most paint programs:
you use three tools (line, fill and freehand) to draw them.
<br><br>You will probably want to start off with the &quot;Line&quot; tool - click the button
in the main panel. Now, draw round the outline of the walkable areas on the
screen. To draw a line, click the left mouse button where you want to start it,
then hold down the button and drag the mouse to the finish of the line, where
you should release the button. Once you are sure that the area is completely
enclosed by blue lines, choose the &quot;Fill&quot; button and click inside the area</b>
it should be filled in. If the entire screen is filled blue, you didn't contain
the area properly. To remove the area, choose the &quot;Wipe colour&quot; mode and then
click on the area. Now, start over again.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.2 WALK-BEHIND AREAS</font></b></u><br><br>
The next job you need to do is to define the walk-behind areas. These areas,
also called &quot;priorities&quot;, tell the game where the character needs to be drawn
behind the background. For example, in the three bottom screens of the demo
game, the player can walk behind the fence.
<br><br>Choose the &quot;Walk-behind&quot; mode from the left-hand list. You add walk-behind
areas in a very similar way to the walkable areas - in fact, you have the same
three drawing tools.
<br><br>Once you have finished, you need to define the base-line for the area. This
is a horizontal line which tells the game at what level the character must be
in order to be drawn behind the area. For example, when the man is standing
in front of the street lamp he must be drawn in front; when he is behind it,
he must be drawn behind. Click the &quot;Base-line&quot; button, then click the mouse
on the scene at the base of the walk-behind area. When the character's feet
are below this line, he will be drawn in front of the area; when his feet are
above the line, he will be drawn behind the area.
<br><br>You may have noticed a window on the screen titled &quot;Editing colour&quot;. By
default, you have been drawing blue walk-behind areas onto the screen. This
is fine for one area, but what if you have two different walk-behind areas on
the screen? They'll need different base-lines, won't they. You can change the
colour you are drawing by clicking the up and down arrows in the &quot;Editing
colour&quot; window. Each colour has its own base-line, which effects the areas
drawn in that colour.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.3 TRYING OUT YOUR GAME</font></b></u><br><br>
Now that you have a semi-complete first room, it would be a good time to test
it out. Go back to the &quot;Setup screen&quot; mode and click &quot;Save room...&quot;. This
will save your work to disk. In the file selector, click near the top on the
line which displays the current directory, then type in the name you want to
give the room file. The game uses files called ROOMx.CRM, where x is the room
number, and the player starts in room 1, so type ROOM1 and press the OK
button.
<br><br>Now, go to the &quot;Game&quot; tab (bottom of the screen), and click the &quot;Save game&quot;
button. This will create all the files necessary to run the game. Click
the &quot;Quit&quot; button to exit the editor. Your game is created as an EXE file
with the name you entered at the very beginning. For example, if you typed
MYGAME as the name for the new game, it will be MYGAME.EXE. Run this to test
your game.
<br><br>You should see your first screen, with the man on it. Walk around the screen,
checking out any walk-behind areas you added. If the man won't move anywhere,
he probably hasn't started on a walkable area and therefore can't move.
Press Ctrl-Q to exit the engine, then load up the Room Editor again. Choose
the &quot;Load room...&quot; button and load in the ROOM1 you saved earlier.
(If you need to change where the man starts, choose the &quot;Visual&quot; tab, then
the &quot;Characters&quot; sub-mode, then click on the &quot;AT 260,190&quot; button on the right
hand side of the screen. Here you can type in the co-ordinates for where you
want the man to start. To get the co-ordinates, use the &quot;Ask position&quot;
function in the Rooms, Setup screen mode).
<br><br>Whenever you want to test your game, ALWAYS save the room you were working on,
and then save the game before exiting the editor.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.4 HOTSPOTS</font></b></u><br><br>
Your room is now almost complete - except for one thing, interactivity. As it
is, the player can't look at anything, talk to anything, or do anything.
A hotspot is an area of the screen where the game will react if the player
clicks the mouse there. For example, a wall could be a hotspot, a fence could
be a hotspot, and so on - in fact, every part of the screen can be one hotspot
or another.
<br><br>Choose the &quot;Hotspots&quot; sub-mode from the Rooms tab. As with the walkable areas
and walk-behind areas, you draw hotspots using the standard three drawing
modes. The different colours this time represent the different game reactions:
the player clicking on a hotspot 1 area will cause a certain response;
clicking on a hotspot 2 area will cause a different response.
<br><br>Once you have drawn the hotspots on, you need to define what happens when the
player interacts with them. You do this one hotspot at a time. Use the up and
down arrow buttons to make sure that colour 1 (dark blue) is the current
hotspot. Now, click the &quot;Interaction&quot; button.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.4.1 INTERACTIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
The interaction window is split up into two parts: the bottom part lists all
the available events on the hotspot which you can add a reaction for. The top
part shows the reactions you have added. To start with, the top window is
empty. To respond to an event, click on the event's name in the bottom window.
For example, we want to display a message when the player LOOKs at our
hotspot 1. So, click &quot;Look at hotspot&quot; on the bottom list. It will be added
to the top list, along with three other columns - Score, Command and Data.
The Score column allows you to give the player points when the event occurs,
and note that this will only happen the first time they do it, so they can't
keep getting more and more points. We don't want to give our player a score
for just looking though, so we'll leave it as 0.
<br><br>The Data column is used to provide additional information to certain commands;
otherwise you can just leave it as 0.
<br><br>The Command column defines what happens when the event occurs (in this case,
when the player looks at our hotspot). Click on the &quot;(Do nothing)&quot; and a menu
appears, with all the possible responses to the event. What these all mean
is listed in section 6.2. We just want to display a message though, so
click the &quot;Display message %d&quot; option. The &quot;%d&quot; simply means that you will
have to type in a number to replace it - in this case, the message number.
On clicking, a window pops up asking you for the message number you want to
display. (We can't just type the message in there and then; we'll do it in a
second). Since this will be our first message, and since message numbering
starts at 0, type in 0 and press return.<br><br>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.4.2 MESSAGES</font></b></u><br><br>
Each room has its own set of messages. These are the strings that can be
displayed during the game. Choose the &quot;Message editor&quot; button at the bottom
of the interaction window. The screen will switch to text-mode and you will
see displayed &quot;No messages&quot;. To create one, press A. Now, press enter to
edit it. Type in a message appropriate to your hotspot, for example,
<br><br>This is a brick wall. Nothing more exciting than that.
<br><br>and press return.
<br><br>Note that pressing F2 toggles &quot;Display next message&quot; on and off. When this
is on, the next message will be displayed after the player has clicked to
remove this one. This feature is useful for conversations and long
<br>descriptions. We won't use it now, however, so leave it set to &quot;No&quot;.
Now hit ESC to leave the message editor. Click OK to exit the interaction
window.
<br><br><br><font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.4.3 WALK-TO SPOTS</font></b></u><br><br>
You may have noticed on the Hotspots screen, a button called &quot;Walk-to&quot;. This
allows you to set a position for each hotspot where the character will walk to
whenever the player interacts with the hotspot. This is like the way the
Lucasarts games like Monkey Island (tm) work. If you set a walk-to point, then
whenever the player clicks interact or talk on the hotspot, the main character
will first walk to that point before the relevant event is triggered.
<br>If you want, the man can also walk there when the LOOK mode is used - this
option is configurable in the Game tab, &quot;Main&quot; sub-mode.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.5 SCREEN EDGES</font></b></u><br><br>
Each room has four &quot;edges&quot;. The edges define how near to the side of the
screen the player needs to go for him to be considered to have left the
screen. More precisely, when the man passes an edge he triggers the related
event in the room interaction screen.
<br><br>Edges are the usual way that room changes take place - when the man walks off
an edge, the game responds with a &quot;Go to screen&quot; command to send him to a new
location.
<br><br>To view the edges, go to the Room tab, &quot;Setup screen&quot; sub-mode, then click
the &quot;Edges&quot; button. The four edges will be displayed as yellow lines on top
of the background. To move an edge, click the left button on it and drag the
mouse.
<br><br>To set what happens when the character walks off an edge, click the
<br><br>&quot;Interaction&quot; button on the &quot;Setup screen&quot; tab. This contains four events,
called &quot;Walk off top&quot;, &quot;Walk off bottom&quot;, and so on, which are triggered when
the man passes the relevant edge. This interaction window also contains some
other useful room events.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.6 OBJECTS</font></b></u><br><br>
Objects, also known as &quot;sprites&quot;, are images on the screen which, unlike the
screen background, can move, change and disappear. You use objects for things
which the player can take (so they disappear) and for things on the screen
which you want to animate.
<br><br>As as example, let's say you want to have a key on the floor of your room
which the player can take. Go to the Rooms tab, &quot;Objects&quot; sub-mode. Now, click
the &quot;New object&quot; button. You now click onto the screen where you want the
object to be added. Don't worry if you don't get its position right, you can
move it later. The object will be added as a blue cup.
<br><br>The first thing we want to do is change the look of the object - obviously, we
want a picture of a key. Click on the picture of the cup near the bottom-right
corner of the screen. When you do, you will be presented with a screen which
shows all the sprite graphics available. There is a picture of a key on the
top row, so click on that. (You can add your own graphics to this list; we
will describe how to do that later).
<br><br>If you want to move the object, click the &quot;Move objects&quot; button. Then, click
and drag the left button on the object to move it.
<br><br>Lastly, we need to define what happens when the player interacts with the
object. Click the &quot;Interaction&quot; button. This is almost identical to the way
it worked with the hotspots (see section 3.1.4.1).
<br><br>You may have noticed a couple of other buttons on the Objects screen, called
&quot;Base-line&quot; and &quot;Object is on&quot;. Normally, the base-line for an object is at
the base of the object (the baseline is used for front-to-back ordered drawing
of the graphics). However, in some cases you may want to override this - for
example, if a poster is lying flat on the ground, you wouldn't want the man to
walk behind it. You can override the baseline for an object by clicking the
&quot;base-line&quot; button and clicking on where you want the base to be (near the top
of the screen would solve our poster problem).
<br><br>Normally, you want the objects to be visible on the screen to begin with.
However, in some situations you may not want the object to appear until later
on in the game. To have the object start the game &quot;off&quot;, click the &quot;Object is
on&quot; button to toggle it. You can switch the object on in the game using the
&quot;Turn on object&quot; command.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The game's speed is directly related to the number of objects on the
screen. Although you probably won't notice it on a Pentium, a room with 10
objects will noticeably slow down on a 486.
<br><br>
Now, we have a fully-working first room. Follow the procedures we did in
section 3.1.3 to try it out.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.1.7 ROOM OPTIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
In the &quot;Setup screen&quot; mode, you can set a few room options by clicking the
&quot;Options&quot; button. This screen allows you to configure some room-specific
things. To change an option, left-click it.<ul>
<li><b>Play music on room load:</b> if set, then the background music will be
changed to the music you specify here. See section 4.1 for information
on the music and sound support in <b>AGS</b>.</li>
<li><b>Main character visible:</b> normally TRUE, if you set this to FALSE then
the main character will not be visible on this screen. This is useful for
close-up control panels, and cutscenes which the main character is not
part of.</li>
<li><b>Main character view:</b> allows you to change the main character's view
number for this screen only. This is useful if you want, for example, an
overhead map screen, so the character should have a birdseye-type view.
The character's view is set back to normal when they leave the screen.</li>
<li><b>Music volume:</b> allows you to change the volume of the background music
for this screen. For example, as the player approaches a bar, on successive
screens the music could get louder.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2 EDITING GAME SETTINGS</font></b></u><br><br>
Now that you know how to create a room, it's time to set up the game-wide
settings. These include inventory objects, global messages, palette setup
and other things which do not depend on individual rooms.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.1 PALETTE SETUP</font></b></u><br><br>
The first thing you need to do when you create a new game is to set up the
palette. This is because all sprite and background scene imports rely on the
palette setup to be the same.
<br><br>Choose the Game tab, &quot;Palette&quot; sub-mode. Here you will see the 256-colour
palette displayed in a grid. Most of the slots are marked &quot;X&quot; - these are the
slots reserved for the background pictures, and will be different in each
room. The other colours will be as they look here for the entire game. These
fixed colours allow things like the main character graphics, which must be
displayed on more than one screen, to work.
<br><br>If you want, you can assign more or less colours to the backgrounds. To toggle
the background assignment on/off, click on the slot, then click the button
&quot;background&quot; (or &quot;un-background&quot;) to swap the slot's status.<br><br>
<font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b></font> You must set up the palette as you want it before you start
making your game - if you change it later, you will have to re-import all the
sprites and background scenes.
<br><br>You can select multiple colour slots by clicking on the first slot, then
shift-clicking on the last slot in the range you want to select. You can then
toggle the background status of all the selected slots at once.
<br><br>The &quot;Export pal&quot; button exports the entire palette to a .PAL or PCX file which
you can then use to read back into the Editor in a different game. If you
choose to export to a pcx file, then a screen shot of the Palette Editor will
be saved as the picture. This way you can see all the game-wide colours in
the file.
<br><br>The &quot;Import pal&quot; button replaces the selected palette entries with those
entries from the PAL or PCX file you choose.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.2 INVENTORY</font></b></u><br><br>
Most adventure games allow the player to carry a set of objects, which he can
then use to solve puzzles. Adventure Game Studio makes this inventory easy
for you to manage.
<br><br>Every inventory item which the player may carry during the game at one time
or another is listed under the Game tab, &quot;Inventory&quot; sub-mode. Here, each item
also has a number which you use in interactions to identify the object.
The left hand side of the screen lists all the items in the game.  On the
right is the graphic used for the object in the inventory window. To change
this, left-click the picture, then select the new graphic from the dialog
which appears.
<br><br>To change the object's name, click the button marked &quot;Name&quot; in the bottom part
of the screen. If you want the player to start the game with this item in his
inventory, check the &quot;Player starts with this item&quot; check-box.
To create a new item, click the &quot;New item...&quot; button. You will be asked for
the new item's name, and then it will be assigned the next available number.
The last thing to do with the inventory items is to define their interactions:
what happens when the player manipulates them in the inventory window. Click
the &quot;Interaction&quot; button, which brings up a window which works identically
to the hotspot interactions (section 3.1.4.1). The available events are
described in the reference section 6.1.4.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Several limitations apply to the commands you can use in the Inventory
interactions. This is because they must run from all rooms, and so cannot
have any room-specific commands. In particular, you cannot use the &quot;Run
animation&quot; or &quot;Run graphical script&quot; commands, and if you use a &quot;Display
message&quot; command, then it must display a global message (see section 3.2.4,
below).
<br><br>To give the item to the player during the game, you use the &quot;Add inventory&quot;
or &quot;Remove obj, add inv&quot; commands. The inventory number required by these
commands is the item number from the list described above.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Each character in the game carries their own set of inventory items.
This means, if you want to create a game like Day of the Tentacle, where the
player can control three different characters, each character will have a
seperate inventory. All inventory commands always operate on the *current
player character*.
<br><br>You have two choices about how the inventory is displayed to the player.
Unfortunately, due to the way the inventory works, the two options are
built-in to the engine and are not customizable.
<br><br>The default option is the Sierra-style pop-up inventory window, which is
popped up by clicking on the Bag icon on the icon bar (which uses the text
script InventoryScreen function to display it).
<br><br>The other option is a Lucasarts-style inventory window. To use this, you
will need to edit the interface to add it, so I will explain this later on.
While you are starting off with <b>AGS</b>, it is recommended to use the supplied
standard Sierra-style inventory window.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.3 USING YOUR OWN SPRITE GRAPHICS</font></b></u><br><br>
When you were choosing the graphics for the object earlier in this tutorial,
you probably noticed that most of the graphics available didn't look up to
much. This is no problem, because you can import your own graphics using
the Sprite Manager.
<br><br>Go to the Visual tab, &quot;Sprite mgr&quot; sub-mode. Here, you will see the complete
sprite set for the game. There are two ways to import your graphics - either
overwrite an existing slot with your graphic, or create a new slot for it.
The &quot;import&quot; button overwrites the currently selected slot; the &quot;import new&quot;
button will create a new slot for the graphic.
<br><br>When you click either of these buttons, the file selector appears, where you
can choose a BMP, PCX or GIF file to import. It must be in no more than 256
colours (8-bit colour depth). The picture is displayed on-screen. The mouse
cursor changes to a rectangle, in which you should enclose the portion of the
graphic which you want to import. You can change the size of the rectangle
by clicking the right mouse button and dragging the mouse. When the rectangle
is correctly positioned, left-click. You can also import the entire picture
by pressing Enter.
<br><br>You may well find that the colours on your graphic look slightly strange in
the Room Editor. This is because the sprites are only allocated, by default,
the first 41 of the palette colours (see the palette section 3.2.1 above), so
your graphic will be remapped to this much smaller palette. If you find that
many of your imported sprites look strange, you can increase the number of
colours assigned to sprites, at the expense of background colours (again see
the section above for information on how to do this).
<br><br>If your sprite will only be used in one room then alternatively you can
use the &quot;use background palette&quot; option, which will remap your graphic to
the palette of the room currently loaded, giving much better results. Note,
however, that if you do this, and then try and use the sprite on another
screen, its colours will most likely be screwed up. To use the room palette,
check the &quot;use bkgrnd pal&quot; check-box. Make sure to un-check this box before
you import any other sprites.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The transparent colour used by <b>AGS</b> is palette index 0. Any pixels you
draw on imported sprites in slot 0 will be transparent.
<br><br>
You can group imported sprites into folders. This prevents the main sprite
list from becoming very long (and you can only have 120 sprites per folder
anyway). By default, the Sprite Manager displays the Main folder, which
contains some graphics and a sub-folder called &quot;Defaults&quot;. Folders work the
same way as Windows folders (or DOS directories) - they can be nested inside
each other, and in every folder except the main one there is a &quot;parent&quot; link
which will take you back to the folder above.
<br>Note, however, that at present you cannot move sprites between folders so
they are stuck in the folder in which you create them. (Imported sprites
are placed into the currently displayed folder). Also, you cannot delete
sprites or folders.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.4 GLOBAL MESSAGES</font></b></u><br><br>
While each room has its own set of messages (&quot;local messages&quot;), in some
situations you need to be able to display a message from more than one room,
or in a global game interaction which is not related to a room. For this
purpose global messages are provided.
<br><br>Choose the Game tab, &quot;Gl. messages&quot; sub-mode. Here you are presented with
a list of the 500 available global message slots. By default, they are all
empty except messages 997-999 which contain the default messages for actions
on the player character. Global messages are numbered between 500 and 999 so
that they are not confused with local room messages.
<br><br>To display a global message, simply use its number in any &quot;Display message&quot;
command.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.5 INTRODUCTION SEQUENCES</font></b></u><br><br>
You can easily add intro, outro and cutscene sequences to your game. There
is no specific function to do these, but using the provided animation and
script commands you can create almost anything you might need.
<br><br>Normally, the game will start in room 1. However, you can change this to any
room you want. Go to the Visual tab, &quot;Characters&quot; mode. Make sure that the
main character is selected in the list on the left. You will see on the right
hand side &quot;Start in room:&quot; followed by &quot;Room 1&quot;. This is the starting room
for the player character, and it is this entry that decides which is the first
room loaded. If you set it to room 0, then a file named INTRO.CRM will be
used (not ROOM0.CRM as you might think). This is for backward compatibility
with AC 1, but it is also good practice and it is suggested that you use this
feature.
<br><br>Set the starting room to room 0. Now, when you run the game, the intro will
be the first room loaded. In this room, you will probably want to disable
the main character (if you want a logo graphic up first). Remember, you do
this through  Setup Screen</b>&gt; Options</b>&gt; Main character visible.
TIP: The starting room facility is also useful when testing your game - you
can make the game start in any room, at the point where you are testing it,
rather than having to keep playing the game through to get there.
<br><br>As an example, let's make your logo stay for 5 seconds and then go on to the
next screen. The graphical script's timer functions would be ideal here.
(You may want to read the graphical script documentation, section 3.3.3,
before continuing here).
<br>Choose  Setup Screen</b>&gt; Interaction. Now, add the &quot;Player enters screen&quot;
event, and set the command to &quot;Run graphical script&quot;. Click the &quot;...&quot; to edit
the script, and add a single command, &quot;Set timer to %d loops&quot;. There are
about 40 loops per second, so replace the %d with 200.
<br><br>Now, press ESC to exit the graphical script editor. You are back at the
interaction screen. Add the &quot;Repeatedly execute&quot; event. Again, set this to
run a graphical script, and click the &quot;...&quot; button. For this script, we will
need the &quot;If timer expired&quot; command, so drag it in from the left. Remove
the &quot;Display message&quot; commands which it gives you, and add a &quot;Go to screen&quot;
command under the IF statement. Choose whatever screen number you want. You
could go to screen 1 to start the game, or to another screen to have a longer
introduction sequence. It's up to you.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.6 ANIMATIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
In most games you will use some sort of animation during the game, whether
it be a flag waving in the breeze or the man bending over to pick something
up. The term &quot;animation&quot; refers to the ability to change the look of, and
move, objects.
<br><br>Animations in <b>AGS</b> are managed using Views. A &quot;view&quot; is a set of one or more
&quot;loops&quot;. A loop is a set of frames which, when put together, give the effect
of movement. Each frame in the view can be set a graphic and a speed.
<br><br>Go to the Visual tab, &quot;Views&quot; sub-mode. This is the View Editor. Here you will
see the main character's walking view.
<br><br>Click the &quot;New view&quot; button to create us a new, empty view. Now, click the
down arrow button until the currently displayed view shows our newly created
one.
<br><br>Each loop is displayed horizontally with its number at the left hand side,
frames going out to the right. To add a frame, click the grey &quot;New frame&quot;
button. To delete a frame, right-click it.
<br><br>To change a frame's graphic, double-left-click it. The sprite list screen
will be displayed (you may remember this from the Object graphic selection)
where you can choose the graphic you want to use for this frame.
<br><br>Above each frame you will see &quot;SPD:0&quot;. This is the frame's *relative* speed,
which you can change by clicking on the word &quot;SPD:&quot;. The larger the number,
the longer the frame stays (ie. the slower it is). When the animation is run,
an overall animation speed will be set, so the actual speed of the frame
will be:  overall_speed + frame_speed  . Note that you can use negative
numbers for the frame speed to make it particularly fast, for example setting
it to</b>3 means that the frame will stay for hardly any time at all.
<br><br>You run an animation by using the &quot;Run animation&quot; interaction command or the
text script animation commands. If you use the &quot;Run animation&quot; interaction
command, you then click the &quot;...&quot; button to edit the animation. The animation
editor is very similar to the graphical script editor (see section 3.3.3),
but it has different commands available.
<br><br>To animate an object, you first of all need to set the object's view to the
correct view number (use the &quot;Set object view&quot; animation command or the
SetObjectView text script command), and then use the &quot;Animate using loop&quot;
animation command or the AnimateObject text script command to actually start
the animation. The Animation Editor commands are described in section 6.8.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.7 CHARACTERS</font></b></u><br><br>
Adventure Game Studio makes it easy to add your own non-player characters
into the game. A character is similar to an object, except that it can change
rooms, maintain its own inventory, and take part in conversations (more on
these later). It can also have its own custom animation speed and movement
speed.
<br><br>Go to the &quot;Visual&quot; tab, &quot;Characters&quot; mode. You will see on the left of the
screen a list of all the characters in the game, with &quot;NEW CHARACTER&quot; at the
end of it. To create a new character, select &quot;NEW CHARACTER&quot; from the list,
then click the &quot;NAME&quot; button in the bottom part of the screen to change its
name to whatever you want to call your character. By doing this, a new
character slot is created.
<br><br>You will see that there are a lot of options which you can set for each
character. First of all, the &quot;This is the player character&quot; check-box allows
you to change which character the player will control at the start of the
game. When the game starts, the first room loaded will be this character's
starting room. By checking this box for one character, it will be de-selected
for any other character which was previously set.
<br><br>Secondly, the &quot;Ignore scaling&quot; check-box allows you to specify that this
character will not be stretched or shrunk in scaling areas of the screen. This
could be useful if you have a character who always stands still in the same
place, and you want the graphics on-screen to be the same size as you drew
them, even though he is standing on a scaling area.
<br><br>The &quot;No interaction&quot; check-box tells <b>AGS</b> that you want the character to be
invisible to all the interaction parts of the game. This is like the way the
main character works in Lucasarts games - if you move the cursor over him
or click to look, speak, etc, then the game will ignore the character and
respond to whatever is behind him.
<br><br>To set which room this character starts in, click the &quot;Room 1&quot; button on the
right hand side of the screen, and type in the new room you want him to start
in. If you set this to room 0 for the player character, he will start in the
intro screen, INTRO.CRM (see section 3.2.5 for information). You can set the
character's location within this room by clicking the &quot;AT 160,160&quot; box and
typing in the X,Y co-ordinates you want him to start at. These co-ordinates
should be the middle of his feet. (You can find out the co-ordinates of a
screen point using the &quot;Ask position&quot; option in the Rooms, Setup Screen tab).
<br><br>The &quot;Default view&quot; is where you set what the character looks like. You must
create a view in the View Editor (described in section 3.2.6, above), and this
view must have 4 loops. Each loop is used for the character walking in one
direction, as follows:<ul>
<li><b>Loop 0:</b> walking down (towards screen)
<li><b>Loop 1:</b> walking left
<li><b>Loop 2:</b> walking right
<li><b>Loop 3:</b> walking up (away from screen)</ul>
Once you set this option, you should see a preview of the character walking
around in the top part of the screen.
<br><br>To change the rate at which the character animates, click the &quot;Anim spd&quot;
option. Here, a smaller number means faster animation. Note that this does NOT
effect the speed at which the character actually moves when walking.
<br><br>The &quot;Move spd&quot; option allows you to control how fast the character moves when
walking. Here, a larger number means he walks faster.
<br><br>The &quot;Talk clr&quot; option on the right of the screen specifies which colour is
used for the text when this character is talking. It effects both messages
displayed with &quot;Display message&quot; commands which are set to that character,
and also conversations. You can find out the colour for each number by going
to the Game tab, &quot;Palette&quot; mode.
<br><br>In the very bottom-right of the screen is a button called &quot;Script Name&quot;. This
sets the name which the character will be referred to by in text scripts and
in conversation scripting. The difference from the main Name of the character
is that the script name may only contain letters A-Z.
<br><br>To set what happens when the player interacts with the character, click the
&quot;Interaction&quot; button. You will be presented with the (by now familiar)
interaction window. NOTE that, as with Inventory interactions, you may NOT
use the &quot;Run animation&quot; or &quot;Run graphical script&quot; commands, or display a local
message. Basically, you need to display global messages or use text scripts
to handle character interactions.
<br><br>You can also set a talking view for the character. To set one, click the
button beside where it says &quot;Talking view:&quot;. If you set a talking view, then
that view will be used to animate the character while they are speaking. You
should generally have about 2-3 frames in each loop (the loops are used for
the same directions as in the main view).
<br><br>New in v2.05 is support for exporting your characters. What this means is that
you can export a character to a file, and then import the file into a
different game - so you can share the same main character between games, or
create one for distribution on the internet. When you click the &quot;Export char&quot;
button, you will be asked what you want to call the file, so type a short
name and press ok. The entire character setup, and graphics, will be exported
to the file. This includes the character's walking and talking graphics.
Then, in RoomEdit (with any game loaded), press the &quot;I&quot; key. The file selector
appears, where you should find the CHA file which you exported earlier. A
new character slot will be created and all the settings imported.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Because importing always creates a new slot, you cannot use it to
overwrite an existing character.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.8 CONVERSATIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
While the old Sierra games were mainly based on action and not talking, the
Lucasarts games took the opposite approach.
<br><br>If you want to create a game with conversations where the player can choose
from a list of optional topics to talk about, you can now with the new Dialog
Editor. Go to the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, Dialog mode.
<br><br>Conversations are made up of Topics. A &quot;topic&quot; is a list of choices from
which the player can choose. You may have up to 14 choices in a topic.
However, not all of them need be available to the player at the start of the
game - you can enable various options for conversation once the player has
said or done other things. For example, when you talk to the man in the demo
game, the first option is just &quot;Hi&quot;. Once he has said this, however, a new
option becomes available.
<br><br>The Dialog Editor is quite self-explanitory - you view one topic at a time,
using the up/down arrow buttons to choose the current topic. Then, you see
the list of options for the topic in the top part of the screen. Each option
has a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; on the right hand side, which specifies whether that
option is available to the player at the start of the game.
<br><br>You control what happens when the player chooses an option by clicking the
&quot;Edit script&quot; button. This is NOT the same script language as the main text
scripts use - it is a much simplified and easier to understand language
specific to dialogs.
<br><br>Each topic has its own script file. When you click &quot;Edit script&quot; for the
first time on a topic, all you will see is a number of lines starting with
an '@' symbol. In the dialog script, these signify the starting points of
the script for each option. For example, when the player clicks on option 3,
the script will begin on the line following &quot;@3&quot;. There is also a special
starting point, called &quot;@S&quot;. This is run when the conversation starts, before
any choices are given to the player. This could be used to display a &quot;Hello&quot;
message or something similar.
<br><br>To display some speech, you begin the line with the character's SCRIPT NAME
(not full name), followed by a colon, then a space, and then what you want
them to say. For example, if my main character's script name is EGO, I would
write
<br><br>ego: &quot;I am very happy today because it's my birthday.&quot;
<br><br>The character name is used by the system to choose the correct colour for
the text. You can have as many lines of speech like this as you want within
the script.
<br><br>To signal the end of the script for this option, place a &quot;return&quot; command on
the last line of it. For example,
<br><br>@1
<br>ego: &quot;Hello. How are you?&quot;
<br>otherman: &quot;I'm fine.&quot;
<br>return
<br><br>This tells the program to go back and display the choices again to the player.
If you use &quot;stop&quot; instead of return, then the conversation is ended. You use
this after the player saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; or something similar.
The dialog commands available are:<ul>
<li><b>goto-dialog X</b>
<br>  Switches the current topic to Topic X, and displays the current list of
<br>  choices for that topic.
<li><b>option-off X</b>
<br>  Turns option X for the current topic off, meaning it won't be displayed in
<br>  the list of choices next time.
<li><b>option-off-forever X</b>
<br>  Turns option X off permanently. It will never again be displayed, not even
<br>  if an &quot;option-on&quot; command is used.
<li><B>option-on X</b>
<br>  Turns option X for the current topic on, including it in the list of choices
<br>  to the player next time they are displayed.
<li><b>play-sound X</b>
<br>  Plays sound effect SoundX.wav or SoundX.voc. You can use this to add speech
<br>  to your game.
<li><b>return</b>
<br>  Stops the script and returns to the list of choices.
<li><b>run-script X</b>
<br>  Runs global text script function &quot;dialog_request&quot;, with X passed as the
<br>  single parameter. This allows you to do more advanced things in a dialog,
<br>  such as adding an inventory item and so on. The &quot;dialog_request&quot; function
<br>  should be placed in your game's global script file, as follows:
<br>    function dialog_request (int xvalue) {
<br>      // your code here
<br>      }
<li><b>stop</b>
<br>  Stops the conversation and returns the player to the game.
<br>For an example of a dialog script, load the demo game into RoomEdit and
look at the script for its topic 0.</ul>
<br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.9 GAME OPTIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
On the Game, Misc tab you may have noticed some check-boxes in the top half
of the screen. These set gamewide options, and mean the following things.
Note that some things listed here are explained later in the documentation,
so if you don't understand one of the items in this list, come back to it
later:<ul>
<li><b>Debug Mode:</B> whether the debug keys are active. When debug mode is on,
you can press Ctrl-X to teleport to any room, Ctrl-S to give all inventory
items, Ctrl-V to display the engine version, and Ctrl-A to display walls on
the screen. When debug mode is off, these do nothing. (More specifically,
the text script Debug() function is disabled).</li>
<li><b>Play sound on score:</B> controls whether a sound effect is played when
the player scores points. If so, you can set the sound number, which will
play SOUNDx.WAV (or SOUNDx.VOC), where X is the number you set.</li>
<li><b>Walk to hotspot in Look mode:</B> controls whether the player will walk
to &quot;walk-to&quot; spots when the player looks at the hotspot. Normally he only
walks on use, speak and use-inv. See section 3.1.4.3 for information.</li>
<li><B>Conversation on GUI:</B> controls where the player's options for dialog are
displayed. If this option is not checked, then in a conversation, the options
will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If you check this box, then
instead the options will be displayed on the GUI you specify.</li>
<li><b>Use &quot;anti-glide&quot; mode:</B> you may notice that, as the character walks, it
can seem as if he is gliding, especially if you have a slow animation speed
setting. When anti-glide mode is on, the man's position is only updated
when the frame of animation changes. You will need to increase each
character's walking speed if you use this option.</li>
<li><b>Text windows use GUI:</b> allows you to customize the standard text window
appearance in the game, using the specified interface element. See section
4.2.3 for more information.</li>
<li><b>Pixel gap between options:</B> defines the gap between the options displayed
to the player in a conversation. Normally this is 0, which means the
<br>options are right below each other. Changing it to 1 or 2 can make the
option display look less cluttered; it's a matter of personal preference.</li>
<li><b>Player can't skip speech text:</B> prevents the player clicking the mouse
to skip conversation text. They can still use the ESC key to skip the text,
however.</li>
<li><b>Buttons off when disabled:</b> specifies that, when an interface button is
disabled, then it is simply not displayed at all. The default action is to
&quot;grey-out&quot; the button by putting alternating black pixels on it.</li>
<li><b>Always display as speech:</B> if you select this option, then all normal
text in the game will be displayed above the main character's head as speech
text, much like the way the Lucasarts games worked. If this option is not
checked, then normal text appears in a pop-up message box, like the way that
the Sierra games worked.</li>
<li><b>Use Sierra-style speech window:</B> normally, when a character talks, the
speech text is displayed above their head in the game, and the character's
talking view is used to animate the actual character. However, if you set
this option then the talking view is used to display an animating graphic
seperately in the top-left of the screen, with the text on the right of it.
This is similar to the way that Space Quest 5, King's Quest 6 and other
later Sierra games worked.</li>
<li><b>Pixel-perfect click detection:</B> normally, when the player clicks the
mouse, <b>AGS</b> just checks to see if the cursor is within the rectangular area
of each character and object on the screen. However, if this option is
checked, then it will further check whether the player clicked on an actual
pixel of the object graphic, or whether it was a transparent part of the
graphic. If this option is enabled and they click on a transparent pixel,
then the hotspot behind the object will be activated instead.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This option does not currently work correctly with scaled characters.</li>
<li><b>No special walk-mode processing:</B> normally, when you click the mouse in
the Walk mode, the main character will move to where you clicked. However,
if you want to create a game all viewed from a 1st-person perspective, and
so don't have a main character, then selecting this option allows you to
use the Walk mode for other things. If selected, then &quot;Character stands on
hotspot&quot; events are instead triggered by clicking the Walk cursor on the
hotspot.</li>
<li><b>Use 320x240 letter-box mode:</B> normally, the available screen resolutions
are 320x200 and 640x400; however, if you select this mode then 320x240 and
640x480 will be used instead. The screeen will be &quot;letter-boxed&quot; - that is,
there will be a black border top and bottom. You may want to use this option
if you need a square pixel aspect ratio for your graphics.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>3.2.10 FONTS</font></b></u><br><br>
Adventure Game Studio allows you to replace the default font and to add your
own. This feature is currently very limited in that you can only import SCI
fonts (Sierra's font format). These can be created in two ways:
<ol>
<li>Extract the font from a Sierra game, using the SCI Decoder program
   available on the internet.
<li>Create your own font and save it in SCI Font format, using the SCI
     Graphic Studio program  (http://scigraphicstudio.cjb.net).</ol>
Go to the &quot;Visual&quot; tab, &quot;Fonts&quot; mode. Here you can see all the current fonts
by using the arrow buttons to cycle through them. You can create a new font
slot by clicking the &quot;New font&quot; button. To import your SCI Font into the
current slot, click the &quot;Import SCI font&quot; button.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT:</b></font>The fonts which will be used for speech should generally also have
an outline font. You can see this with the default fonts, font 1 is the speech
font, which is drawn in the character's colour, and font 2 is the outline font,
which is drawn in black behind the speech in the game. This helps avoid any
colour clashes between the font and the background.
<br><br>To set a font to have an outline font, select the main (coloured) font as the
current font, then click the &quot;No outline&quot; button. You will be prompted for
the font number of the outline font, so type it in.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Font 0 is used as the normal text font, and font 1 is used as the
speech font. Therefore any extra fonts you add cannot be used.

<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3 OTHER ROOM FEATURES</font></b></u><br><br>
This section describes slightly more advanced things you can do with the
rooms.
<br><br><br><font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3.1 CHARACTER SCALING</font></b></u><br><br>
AGS</b> supports scaling of characters, where the character can appear to get
smaller as he walks away from the screen. Character scaling is supported as
part of the walkable areas in a room.
<br><br>The reason why you have multiple colours available for the walkable areas is
because you can set a zoom level for each colour, which defines how large
the character will be while he is in that area. The default for all walkable
areas is 100%, ie. full size. However, you can adjust it using the &quot;Walkable
Areas&quot; mode to anywhere from 10% (one-tenth size) to 200% (double size).
<br><br>The scaling settings effect all CHARACTERS in the game, but not objects. You
can disable the scaling for an individual character by checking the &quot;ignore
scaling&quot; box in that character's properties.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3.2 SCROLLING</font></b></u><br><br>
If you've been wondering, I'll tell you now: Yes, you can create scrolling
rooms, like the ones used in Lucasarts games like Monkey Island (tm) and Day
of the Tentacle.
<br><br>To create a scrolling room, just import a scene that is larger than 320x200.
For example, 500x200 is a good size for Lucasarts-type rooms.
<br><br>When you import the scene, a message box will appear asking you what
resolution the picture is drawn for - this is because the picture could
either be a scrolling room at 320x200, or a single non-scrolling screen at
640x400. So,  with a 500x200 room you would click the &quot;320x200&quot; button.
That's all you have to do. Draw on the walkable areas, hotspots and so on, as
normal, and then save the room. The screen will follow the main character
around.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>TIP:</b></font> You can also have scrolling hi-res rooms. Just import a scene which is
larger than 640x400.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3.3 GRAPHICAL SCRIPTS</font></b></u><br><br>
While <b>AGS</b> provides a comprehensive text scripting system, there are some
occasions when it is easier and neater to use a graphical script. Also, if
you are new to scripting, the graphical script is the best way to learn.
A graphical script is the easiest way to add several responses to an event.
Normally, when an event occurs, you can only set one reaction using the
Interaction window, which limits your possibilities. But, by using a graphical
script, you can do much more complex things.
<br><br>At its simplest, a graphical script is just a list of commands which are
carried out from top to bottom. For example, a &quot;Display message&quot; command
followed by a &quot;Remove object&quot; command. But the graphical script's main power
is in conditional statements - that is, commands which may or may not be
executed, depending on other factors.
<br><br>To support conditional statements, the graphical script uses flags. Each flag
is either &quot;Set&quot; or &quot;Clear&quot;. All the flags start off clear, and you can set
a flag to the &quot;Set&quot; state to signal that some sort of event has occured.
There are two types of flags - Local flags and Global flags. Local flags are
specific to each room, and you can give the flag a name when you create it.
Global flags are available to every room in the game. They are named GLOBAL1
to GLOBAL50, and changing one of these flags from one room's graphical script
will also change it for all other rooms.
<br><br>The graphical script editor displays the current script on the left hand
side of the screen, and the list of available commands on the right. When you
start a new script, you will have a single &quot;Display message&quot; command on the
script to the left. To add a new command, drag it from the list on the right
to below the &quot;display message&quot; on the left. You will be asked to type in the
number to replace the %d if the command requires it; this is the same way as
it works in the Interaction windows. To delete a command, drag it over to the
right. You can modify a command's properties by right-clicking it.
<br><br>When you add conditional (&quot;if&quot;) statements, an indented &quot;display message&quot;
command will be added below it. The indented commands will only be carried out
if the condition is true. For example, consider this script:
<br><br>Display Message 1              &lt;-- &quot;You turn around to face the key&quot;
<br>If flag GOTKEY is set
<br>Display Message 2            &lt;-- &quot;But it's gone. You've already taken it&quot;
<br>Stop Script
<br>Set flag GOTKEY
<br>Display Message 3              &lt;-- &quot;You pick up the key&quot;
<br>Add Inventory 2
<br>Give Score 5
<br><br>You can create this yourself by dragging the commands over from the right.
The first time the script is run, GOTKEY will be Clear (remember, all flags
start &quot;Clear&quot;), the player will get the key and 5 points, and GOTKEY will
be &quot;Set&quot;. The next time the script is run, instead of getting another key,
the player will be told they already have it, and the script is aborted.
(The &quot;Stop Script&quot; command tells the game not to carry out the rest of the
script).
<br><br>Commands like &quot;Give score&quot; WILL be carried out every time they are encountered
(in the Interaction windows, the score is only given once), so you must make
sure to use conditional statements so that the player can't keep repeating
the action if you don't want them to.
<br><br>Descriptions of the special graphical script commands are available in
section 6.7, below.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3.4 IMPORTING A FILE AS THE WALKABLE AREA MASK</font></b></u><br><br>
<b>AGS</b> now has the ability to import an external BMP or PCX file to use as the
walkable-area, hotspot or walk-behind area mask. If you don't like the way
you have to draw these in RoomEdit itsself, you can draw them in another
program and then import them. This is also useful if you are converting a
game you were making with another game-creation system into <b>AGS</b>.
<br><br>To use the feature, click the &quot;IMPORT FILE&quot; button in the relevant mode of
the Room Editor. There are some restrictions to how this file must be drawn:
it must be the exact same size as the background scene (but in the 320x200
resolution), and it must be in 16-colour (4-bit) or 256-colour (8-bit). Then,
colour 0 on the bitmap signifies transparency and colours 1-15 are used as the
respective hotspot/walk-behind/walkable area numbers. For example, if you have
a 640x400 hi-res background scene, the mask bitmaps must be 320x200 size.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Do NOT use any colour numbers above 15 on the mask bitmap. Use only
palette indexes 0 to 15.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>3.3.5 ANIMATING BACKGROUND SCENES</font></b></u><br><br>
If you want to have a lot of animation on the screen, you will come across
two problems if you try to do it using objects:<ol>
<li>There is a limit of 10 objects per screen, so you may not be able to
  animate everything that you want to.
<li>Objects slow down the game - the more objects on the screen, the slower
  the game runs.
<li>The solution to these problems is to use an animating background scene.</ol>
How it works is this: Each room can have from 1 to 5 backgrounds. Normally,
each room just has one background. However, you can import up to four extra
backgrounds in each room, and if you do so then the game will cycle through
them, giving the effect of animation.
<br><br>This gives two main advantages - you can animate the entire screen, and due
to the way the engine works, it doesn't slow down the game at all.
<br><br>To import a second background for a room, load the room into RoomEdit, then
go to the Room tab, Setup Screen mode, and click the &quot;Anim bkgrnd&quot; button. A
screen appears, which lists the current backgrounds for the room. To import
a new background, click where it says &quot;None&quot;. To delete a background, click
the &quot;Del&quot; button on the relevant row. That's all there is to it. To leave the
background editor, press any key.
<br><br>You can adjust the speed of the animation by clicking the &quot;SPD&quot; button, which
is just under the &quot;Anim bkgrnd&quot; button. Smaller number means faster animation,
and the default is 5.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> All the background scenes must be the same size.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> All scenes are mapped to the palette of the first scene - this should
not be a problem, but if you use very different colours in the different
frames, you may need to fine-tune the graphics.
<br><br><br>
<a name="#features"></a><font color=#0000a0><b><u>4. OTHER FEATURES</u></b></font><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.1 MUSIC AND SOUND</font></b></u><br><br>
All good games use sound to involve and immerse the player in the game. <b>AGS</b>
allows you to play a background music track, and also to play sound effects
at appropriate times.
<br><br>The DOS version of <b>AGS</b> supports Adlib, Sound Blaster and General MIDI for
background music, and it supports the Sound Blaster and ESS Audiodrive for
sound effects.
<br><br>The Windows version of <b>AGS</b> supports all DirectX-compatible sound cards.
For background music, <b>AGS</b> can use MIDI, MOD, XM, S3M and MP3 music files. For
sound effects, you can use WAV and VOC files.
<br><br>When <b>AGS</b> needs to play music number X, it will search for the files in the
following order. The first file it finds, it plays: MUSICx.MID, MUSICx.MP3,
MUSICx.MOD, MUSICx.XM, MUSICx.S3M.
<br><br>
<font color=#a00000><b>WARNING:</b></font> A warning about MP3 - because mp3s are compressed it places a massive
load on your computer's processor playing them back, since it has to decode
all the data as well as playing it. For that reason, it is not recommended to
use MP3s at all with <b>AGS</b>, even though they are supported.
<br>For example, my Pentium-233 system can quite happily manage 50 fps in SVGA
hi-res mode normally, but in a room with an MP3 background music the frame
rate drops in half to about 20 fps. If the engine detects a 386 or 486
processor it will automatically disable MP3 music. If you want to have a
digital soundtrack, use XM or MOD instead, as these cause hardly any overhead
for the CPU.
<br><br>
When the game loads, music 0 will be played if it exists in the game directory.
You can change the music later by setting &quot;Play music on room load&quot; in a room
(see section 3.1.7 for information), by using the PlayMusic text script
command, or by using the &quot;Play sound&quot; interaction command. If you use the
interaction command, you must add 1000 to the music number so that <b>AGS</b>
recognises it as music and not a sound effect. For example, to play music 23,
use &quot;Play sound 1023&quot;.
<br><br>To play a sound effect during the game, you can use the PlaySound text script
command, or the &quot;Play sound&quot; interaction command. The game will search for
SOUNDx.WAV and SOUNDx.VOC, where X is the sound number.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The Adlib sound card only supports MIDI music. It cannot play sound
effects, or MOD, XM or MP3 music.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Currently, any MP3 music you have will NOT be included in the file
built when you distribute your game. You will have to distribute MP3 files
seperately along with the main game file. Section 4.3 describes game
distribution.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2 EDITING THE INTERFACE</font></b></u><br><br>
<b>AGS</b> now supports customizable interfaces. By default, the game interface is
set up to act like Sierra's point-and-click interface of its 1990-93 games.
<b>AGS</b> v2.07 has a completely re-written interface system, now called the GUI
system. (The name change is to help distinguish the new system from the old
system). A description of what's changed from the last version is in
section 4.2.5, below.
<br><br>To change the interface (recommended for advanced users only), go to the Game
tab, &quot;GUI&quot; mode.
<br><br>The game interface is split up into GUI &quot;elements&quot;. Each element is a
rectangular region on the screen which is drawn on top of the background
scene. Each element can be set to either:<ul>
<li>be always displayed (for example the Sierra status-line)
<li>pop-up when the mouse moves to a certain position (eg. Sierra icon-bar)
<li>pop-up on script command only
</ul>The default interface is made up of two elements - the status line, and the
icon bar.
<br><br>In the GUI Editor, you will see several buttons. The &quot;Export GUI&quot; button
exports the entire interface (ie. all the GUIs, plus button graphics) to a
file, which you can then import later into a different game using &quot;Import GUI&quot;.
This allows you to design your interface and then use it in all your games.
<br><br>The &quot;New GUI&quot; button creates a new element. You can change which element you
are editing by clicking the up and down arrow buttons.
<br><br>In the top part of the screen the current GUI element is displayed. You can
change the size of the rectangle by dragging the lower-right hand corner of
it with the mouse.
<br><br>You will also notice a window titled &quot;Properties&quot;. This allows you to edit
the various properties of the GUI, and it works something like Visual Basic
(tm)'s Properties window. In the Properties window, you can change the
background colour of the GUI, set a background picture, and manually set the
location and width/height amongst other things.
<br><br>The &quot;Visible&quot; property allows you to set when the GUI is displayed. The
default is &quot;Always&quot;, which is like the Sierra status-line: always present
on the screen. The &quot;Script only&quot; option means that the GUI will be initially
off and must be turned on by a text script command. The &quot;Mouse YPos&quot; option
means that the GUI only appears when the mouse vertical position moves above
the y-coordinate set with the &quot;Popup-YP&quot; option.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2.1 GUI BUTTONS</font></b></u><br><br>
To provide interactivity with the interface, you use buttons. There is no
limit to the number of buttons per GUI, but the game can only contain a total
of 50 GUI buttons.
<br><br>To add a button, click the &quot;Add button&quot; button, and then drag a rectangle
with the mouse onto the GUI. You will see it displayed as a text button, with
the text &quot;New button&quot; on. Notice that the Properties window is now displaying
properties for your new button rather than the GUI.
<br><br>Using the Properties window, you can set a picture for the button instead,
and you can also set various other self-explanitory attributes.
<br><br>You set what happens when the player clicks on the button by using the &quot;Left
clk&quot; attribute. This can be set to &quot;Do nothing&quot; (the default), and also &quot;Set
mode&quot;, which changes the cursor mode to the mode specified in the &quot;Clk data&quot;
property. The other option, &quot;Run script&quot;, runs the &quot;interface_click&quot; text
script function, passing the GUI number and button number of the clicked
button.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2.2 INTERFACE TEXT</font></b></u><br><br>
You can also display text on interfaces. For example, the Sierra-style
interface displays the score in the status bar.
<br><br>To add text to a GUI, you add a label. Click the &quot;Add label&quot; button, then
drag out a rectangle like you did when adding a button. You can change the
text displayed in the label by editing the &quot;Text&quot; property. Notice that the
text automatically wraps round to fit inside the rectangle you drew.
<br><br>As well as typing normal text into the label, you can add some special markers
which allow the text to change during the game. The following tokens will be
replaced with the relevant values in the game:<ul>
<li><b>@GAMENAME@</b> - The game's name, specified on the Game, Misc tab
<li><b>@OVERHOTSPOT@</b> - Name of the hotspot which the cursor is over
<li><b>@SCORE@</b> - The player's current score
<li><b>@SCORETEXT@</b> - The text &quot;Score: X of XX&quot; with the relevant numbers filled
                in. This string will be in the user's chosen language.
<li><b>@TOTALSCORE@</b> - The maximum possible score, specified on Game, Misc tab</ul>
<b><font color=#a00000>EXAMPLE:</font></b> You have @SCORE@ out of @TOTALSCORE@ points.
<br><br>The Properties window also allows you to align the text to left, right or
centre, as well as change its font and colour.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2.3 TEXT WINDOWS</font></b></u><br><br>
If you want to add a personal touch to the standard white text-boxes which
display all the messages during the game, you can create a border using the
GUI Editor. Create a new GUI element, and check the &quot;text window&quot; box for it.
The element will be resized to about 1/4 of the screen, and you will see 8
pictures - one in each corner and one on each side. These are the border
graphics. You change the graphic for a corner in the normal way.
<br><br>In the game, the corner graphics will be placed in the respective corners of
the text window, and the side graphics will be repeated along the edge of
the window. To tell the game to use your custom text window style, go to the
Game tab, &quot;Misc&quot; mode, and check the &quot;Text windows use GUI&quot; box in the top
part of the screen. When prompted, enter the number of the interface element
which you used.
<br><br>You can also set a background picture for the text window. In the GUI editor,
simply set a background picture for the GUI element. The graphic you specify
will not be tiled or stretched in the game; however, it will be clipped to
fit the window. You should use a graphic of at least about 250x80 pixels to
make sure that it fills up the whole window.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2.4 LUCASARTS-STYLE INVENTORY</font></b></u><br><br>
The final option you may have noticed in the GUI editor is the &quot;Add Inventry&quot;
button. This allows you to drag out a rectangle which will display the
player's current inventory, in the same way as the Lucasarts games did. To
make the inventory window scrollable, you will need to add Up and Down arrow
buttons, and attach text script code to those buttons to use the avaialble
variables such as game.top_inv_item, described in section 6.4.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.2.5 UPGRADING INTERFACES TO GUIs</font></b></u><br><br>
When you load a v2.06 or earlier game into RoomEdit, it will display a message
telling you that the interfaces have been upgraded. Most of the process is
automatic - however, you should check the new GUIs to make sure they converted
properly. Also, any interface text which you were using is not converted - you
will need to re-create it using labels.
<br><br>A couple of major things to note with the new GUIs:
<ul><li>First, you can no longer access interface properties, like vtext, from the
text script using the &quot;iface&quot; variable. Code using this will still compile
and run, but will not have any affect on the game.
<li>You can now change the text instead by using the SetLabelText function</b>
described in the text script reference, section 6.3.
<li>Also, the &quot;$c&quot;, &quot;$r&quot; and &quot;$l&quot; alignment t<b>AGS</b> for the status bar text are
no longer supported - they have been replaced by the &quot;Align&quot; attribute of
labels.
<li>Finally, it is currently not possible to delete buttons or GUIs.</ul>
<br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.3 DISTRIBUTING YOUR GAME</font></b></u><br><br>
When you choose the &quot;Save game...&quot; button in the Room Editor, as well as
creating data files which it needs for itsself, the program will create an
executable file with the name of your game, in the directory above where all
the other files are stored.  This single file contains all of the program
code and data for your game, and is the file you should distribute. You may
remember that AC v1.14 included the ability to make a data file so that you
only needed to distribute it and the exe file - well this goes one step
further! Copy the USERGAME.EXE file to another directory or drive, or even
another computer, and there you have your game, contained in a single file!
Note, though, that you should also include the SETUP.BAT file to allow the
user to run the Setup program.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> It is not possible to load the exe file back into the Room Editor. This
means two things when only the EXE file is available: (1) other people can't
edit your game's data, and (2) you can't either. Always keep a backup of the
other files produced (*.CRM, AC2GAME.DTA, etc) as they are what the Editor
needs to be able to load your game for editing.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> You may need to edit the SETUP.BAT file to replace the &quot;AC&quot; line with
whatever you called your exe file.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Read the LICENSE.TXT file included for information on what you may, and
may not, distribute with your game.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> MP3 music files are not included in the exe. You must include them
seperately in your game's distribution.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.4 TEXT SCRIPTING</font></b></u><br><br>
Version 2 of <b>AGS</b> includes a radically overhauled text scripting system which
is now much more powerful and allows you much greater control of the game
through the scripts, if that is what you want to do.
<br><br>The script language is based on the 'C' programming language, and anyone
familiar with C should be able to pick it up very quickly. If not, I will
introduce it now:
<br><br>Basically, the script consists of FUNCTIONS. Each function (think of it as
an event handler) is run when a particular event occurs. For example, the
&quot;on_key_press&quot; function is run whenever the user presses a key on the keyboard.
The code within the function is executed in procedural fashion - ie. from the
top downwards, one statement at a time. The function outlines look as follows:<br><br>
function name_of_function() {
<br>  // your code here
<br>  }
<br><br>The keyword FUNCTION identifies this as the start of the function. Next is
the function's name. This can consist of any letters A-Z, plus underscores.
Note that spaces and numerical digits are NOT allowed in the name. After the
name are the brackets (). These define what parameters will be passed to the
function. In this case, there are none. Next comes the  {  symbol. This
signifies the start of the code block. Execution of the function starts after
this symbol and finishes at the  }  symbol, which signifies the end of the
function.
<br><br>To store information, you use variables. A VARIABLE is a block of memory which
holds a number or string of text. You define a variable as follows:
<br><br>int  my_counter ;
<br><br>The &quot;int&quot; is the type of variable you want to create. Available types are
&quot;char&quot;, which stores a 1-byte character, &quot;int&quot; which stores a 32-bit integer,
and also &quot;string&quot; which stores up to a 200-byte text string.
The &quot;my_counter&quot; is the name of the variable. You then use this name in the
script to refer to the variable.  The semicolon marks the end of the statement.
The scripting language requires every statement to end with a semicolon. If
you get a &quot;Parse error&quot; when your script is compiled, this is the first thing
to check.
<br><br>You declare variables at the top of the script, BEFORE any functions.
<br><br>To assign a value to a variable, use the  =  operator. For example,
<br><br> my_counter = 1;
<br><br>will set the &quot;my_counter&quot; variable to 1. Notice again the semicolon - they are
required after every statement. You can also add variables together, and do
simple maths with the assignments. For example,
<br><br>my_counter = other_counter - 5;
<br><br>will set &quot;my_counter&quot; to the value of &quot;other_counter&quot; minus 5.
I think it's time for an example script function. So:
<br><br>function on_key_press(int key_code) {
<br>my_counter = my_counter + 1;
<br>}
<br><br>The above script will increment the &quot;my_counter&quot; variable every time a key is
pressed.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> If you are simply adding a value to a variable, shortcuts are available.
These are the  +=  and </b>=  operators. For example,  &quot;my_counter += 1;&quot;  is
equivalent to   &quot;my_counter = my_counter + 1;&quot;.
<br><br>To compare variables, you use the IF keyword with the following operators:<br><br>
==   is equal to
<br>&gt;    is greater than
<br>&lt;    is less than
<br>!=   is not equal to
<br><br>For example,
<br><br>  if ( my_counter &lt; 5 ) {
<br>    my_counter = my_counter + 1;
<br>    }
<br><br>will increment &quot;my_counter&quot; if it is less than 5. Note the use of the curly
brackets again - these define what code will be executed depending on the
result of the comparison.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> You will notice that the &quot;is-equal-to&quot; operator == is different from
the assignment operator = . Do not get these mixed up, because using a single
equals in an &quot;if&quot; statement can cause major bugs in your script.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b></font> Do NOT use the = or == operators with string variables, or
you will get strange results. You must use the provided functions (whose
names begin with &quot;Str&quot;) to compare and assign strings. This is VERY IMPORTANT.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b></font> The script system is case-sensitive. That means, that the
variable names &quot;my_counter&quot;, &quot;My_Counter&quot; and &quot;MY_COUNTER&quot; are all different.
<br><br>
To call a function (listed in the section 6.3, below), you use the function
name, followed by its parameters in parenthesis, then a semicolon. For
example, to add inventory item 2 to the player's inventory, do this:
<br><br>AddInventory (2);
<br><br>The space between the function name and parenthesis is optional.
<br><br>If the function returns a value, you can capture it using the standard '='
operator. So, for example:
<br><br>int currentchar;
<br>currentchar = GetPlayerCharacter();
<br><br>will store the current player character number in the currentchar variable.
You can also use the function directly in a statement much as you would
use a variable, for example:
<br><br>if (IsGamePaused() == 1) {
<br>  // your code here
<br>  }
<br><br>would execute the code if the IsGamePaused function returned 1.
<br><br>
<font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> If you are an experienced programmer, please NOTE THE FOLLOWING: The
compiler will allow you to use 'C'-type pointers in your code, for example
using int*, char* and so on. However, DO NOT DO THIS as the data will be
corrupted when the user does a Save/Load game position.
<br><br>
Adventure Game Studio has two types of script files - &quot;global&quot; scripts and
&quot;local&quot; scripts. There is one global script in a game, and it is always
loaded in memory. This is the script which contains instructions for game-wide
events, like the key_press event.
<br><br>Each room file also has its own local script. Both types of script use the
same syntax and have the same functions available to them. The local script
for a room is only in memory while that room is loaded, in order to save
memory. So although you could put all your code into the global script, using
the local scripts for functions which you only need in that particular room
will save memory and help speed up the game.
<br><br>To edit a room's local script, load the room into the Room Editor, and then
choose the &quot;Edit scripts&quot; button from the ROOM, Setup Screen tab.
To edit the game's global script, click the &quot;Edit script&quot; button on the GAME,
Misc tab.
<br><br>
If you want to share information between room scripts and the global script,
there are 100 global variable slots which you can store numbers in.
<br><br>Use the function  SetGlobalInt (index, value);   to set variable INDEX to
VALUE, and then  GetGlobalInt (index);  to get the value back again.
<br><br>You can access the graphical script's global flags by using the gs_globals[]
array, but the numbers are shifted down one. So,  gs_globals[3]  is GLOBAL4
from the graphical script. A value of 1 means flag set and 0 means clear.
<br><br>
Currently it is not possible to call functions in other scripts - that is,
you can't write a function in the global script, and call it from a room
script. I hope to add support for this in a later version.
<br><br>
All co-ordinates used with functions in the script system are from 0 to 319
for X and from 0 to 199 for Y, where (0,0) is the top-left corner of the
screen, and (319, 199) is the bottom-right corner. This is independant of the
screen resolution the user is using - all co-ordinates are converted to the
320x200 scheme for scripting.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> In a scrolling room, the maximum co-ordinates are larger than this. To
find out, go to the Rooms, Setup Screen tab, and load in your scrolling room.
Under the &quot;Options&quot; button is a line which says: &quot;Size: 320 x 200&quot; (or
whatever the size of your room is). The co-ordinates you can use range from
0 to the width/height minus 1. Remember that you can use the &quot;Ask Position&quot;
button to find out the co-ordinates of a point on the room.
<br><br>
A complete list of all the functions and variables available in the text
script system is in section 6.3, below.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.4.1 TEXT SCRIPT EVENTS</font></b></u><br><br>
In your main global script file, there are some functions which are
automatically added when you create the game. These are &quot;events&quot;, and the
function is called when a particular event happens. There are also some
other events which you can add if you want to.
<br><br>The available event functions are:</ul>
<li><b>dialog_request (int parameter)</b>
<br>  Called when a dialog script line &quot;run-script&quot; is processed. PARAMETER is
  the value of the number following the &quot;run-script&quot; on that line of the
  dialog script.
<li><b>game_start ()</b>
<br>  Called at the start of the game, before the first room is loaded. You can
  use this to set up the initial positions of characters, and to turn
  interfaces on and off.
<li><b>interface_click (int interface, int button)</b>
<br>  Called when the player clicks on a button on an interface which has its
  action set as &quot;Run script&quot;. INTERFACE is the number of the GUI which they
  clicked on. BUTTON is the object number of the button within this GUI.
<li><b>on_key_press (int keycode)</b>
<br>  Called whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard. KEYCODE holds the ASCII
  value of the key. A list of these values is in section 6.6, below.
<li><b>on_mouse_click (int button)</b>
<br>  Called when the player clicks a mouse button. BUTTON is either LEFT or
  RIGHT, depending on which button was clicked. The &quot;mouse.x&quot; and &quot;mouse.y&quot;
  global variables contain the mouse's position.
<li><b>repeatedly_execute ()</b>
<br>  Called every game cycle (normally 40 times per second).
<br><br><br></li>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>4.4.2 OTHER SCRIPT NOTES</font></b></u><br><br>
Only one text script can be executing at any one time. A script is considered
to be &quot;executing&quot; if there is still code left in a script function that needs
to be executed.
<br><br>What this means is that if you call a function like MoveCharacterToObject,
which is BLOCKING - that is, it waits until the character finishes moving
before continuing the script - then while the character is moving no other
scripts will be run (for example, repeatedly_execute scripts).
<br><br><br>
<a name="#upgrading"></a><font color=#0000a0><b><u>5. UPGRADING FROM AC v1</u></b></font><br><br>
If you have used AC version 1.xx, and you want to continue with a game you
were making using this new version, this section describes the major changes
and what to do about them.
<br><br>Of course, first of all you will need to get to know the new Room Editor. I'd
recommend reading through the tutorial in this file, as it will introduce you.
Instead of the old Condition List, the conditions are now split up into the
individual events. Where there are conditions now, an &quot;Interaction&quot; button is
available on those tabs. Clicking this gives a window where you can set the
responses you want to implement for those events.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>5.1 CHANGES FROM v1</font></b></u><br><br>
MAJOR CHANGES<ul>
<li>The walls system has been completely changed. Now, instead of defining the
walls on the screen, you instead define where the character CAN walk, by
using walkable areas. This is to stop the problem where the player could
wriggle through the walls. The shadow screen (Special menu of old RoomMake)
has been incorporated into the walls screen - you can colour-code the
<br>walkable areas, and each colour can be assigned a view number.</li>
<li>When importing old rooms, all misc conditions are lost. You must check each
room, and if it uses misc conditions, replace them with either a graphical
script or text script. The Room Editor will warn you if you load an old room
file which uses misc conditions.</li>
<li>There is no longer just one text script file which you edit and then compile.
Now, text scripts are built into the room files (local text scripts) and
into the main game file (global text scripts).</li>
</ul>
OTHER CHANGES<ul>
<li>The X,Y co-ordinate positions of the characters are now the bottom-middle
of the character (in AC 1 it was the bottom-left). This makes the pathfinding
much better than before because the man won't walk over the walls on the
right. Note that the objects are still bottom-left.</li>
<li>In the text script, the player's inventory now has a different variable name:
it is now  &quot;character[EGO].inv[X]&quot;  rather than just  &quot;inv[X]&quot;. This is
because v2 supports different characters each carrying their own inventory.</li>
<li>The &quot;runcondition&quot; text script command has been removed. It was confusing
and everything which it could do is now done seperately by different
<br>commands.</li>
<li>In fact, the whole text script system has been changed, once again.
Sorry. I promise to keep it this way from now on :-)  But you'll be glad
to know that the language is still the same, just the commands are different.
I'd recommend reading sections 4.4 (intro to text scripting) and more
<br>importantly 6.3 (text script command reference) to introduce yourself.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>5.2 STEP-BY-STEP: CONVERTING v1 GAMES</font></b></u><br><br>
Converting a game from version 1 is made easier by the &quot;Import old&quot; feature
of the new Room Editor. Load the Room Editor, then on the Game, Main tab click
the &quot;Import old&quot; button. This brings up the file selector where you should find
the INI file for your old game. All the relevant settings will then be
imported. This function also imports the old sprite set and views from your
game, but ONLY if the required files (USERSPR.SPR and ACVIEWS.DAT) are in the
current directory.
<br><br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Any old text scripts you had in v1 will not be imported; since the text
script system has changed radically for this version they probably won't work
anyway. See the section above for information on some of the differences.
<br><br>
Next, you must upgrade each room. Load each room, one by one, into RoomEdit.
Go to the &quot;Walkable areas&quot; tab and draw on the room's walkable areas (the old
walls will be displayed there for you to see how the room was set up).
If the room used any misc conditions, you must replace these by writing a
graphical or text script instead to perform the same function.

<font color=#00a000><b><u>5.4 WHY THE NAME CHANGE?</font></b></u><br><br>
This program was originally called the Adventure Creator. It started off life
that way in 1996 as AC v1.00, and finally evolved into the last release, v1.14.
However, recently people have suggested, and I have agreed, that a name change
is probably in order. There are several reasons for this:<ul>
<li>There is another system, also called Adventure Creator, for the Macintosh.
This caused some confusion, and if at any point in the future I wanted to
do a Mac port of AC, it would make the situation very difficult.</li>
<li>I have re-written the entire program from scratch for v2. Although a few
parts of old code remain, to enable loading old room files and the like, I
wanted to change the name to emphasise that this new version is (hopefully)
a lot different and improved over the last one.</li>
<li>A few people mentioned that the name &quot;Adventure Creator&quot; implied that the
program would only create adventure games, and not be able to run them (eg.
they thought it created games for Sierra's interpreter). The new name
implies a full range of features for creating and playing the games.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<a name="#reference"></A><font color="#0000a0"><b><u>6. COMMAND REFERENCE</font></b></u><br><br>
This section contains a complete reference for the room &quot;interaction&quot; events
and commands, and a comprehensive description of all the text script functions
available.
<br><br><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>6.1 INTERACTION EVENTS</font></b></u><br><br>
The following events are available in Interaction windows:<br>
<br><br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.1.1 HOTSPOT INTERACTIONS<ul></font></b></u>
<li><b>Character stands on hotspot:</B> occurs repeatedly while the player character
is standing on the hotspot.</li>
<li><b>Look at hotspot:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot while in
the &quot;Look&quot; mode (cursor mode 1).</li>
<li><b>Interact with hotspot:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot while
in the &quot;Interact&quot; mode (cursor mode 2).</li>
<li><b>Use inventory on hotspot:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot
while in the &quot;Use inventory&quot; mode (cursor mode 4), but ONLY if the player
is using the inventory item number which the Data column is set to. For
example, if you want to respond when the player is using a key (inventory
item 2), then set Data to 2. You can also set Data to 99, in which case the
event will trigger for any inventory item:</b> in this case, you can use the
&quot;If inventory %d was used&quot; graphical script command (see section 6.7), or the
text script variable character[x].activeinv (see section 6.4) to find out
what was used.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT:</b></font> When this event is triggered, and if Data is not 99, then the
player will lose the inventory item.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Because the Data column is used for the event, you cannot use a
response which also requires a Data value. You must use a text script or
graphical script to respond in this case.</li>
<li><b>Speak to hotspot:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot while in
the &quot;Talk&quot; mode (cursor mode 3).</li>
<li><b>Any click on hotspot:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot in
any cursor mode (except Walk). This allows you to add extra modes like
smell, taste, push, pull, and so on. This event also occurs as well as
the other event for the Look, Interact and Talk modes.</li>
<li><b>Mouse moves over hotspot:</b> occurs repeatedly while the mouse cursor is
over the hotspot. You can use this to highlight the cursor, and for other
various effects.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.1.2 OBJECT INTERACTIONS<ul></font></b></u>
<li><b>Look at object:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the object while in
the &quot;Look&quot; mode (cursor mode 1).</li>
<li><b>Interact with object:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the object in
the &quot;Interact&quot; mode (cursor mode 2).</li>
<li><b>Speak to object:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the object in the
&quot;Talk&quot; mode (cursor mode 3).</li>
<li><b>Use inventory on object:</b> works like &quot;Use inventory on hotspot&quot; - see
that desccription (section 6.1.1 above) for more information.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.1.3 ROOM INTERACTIONS<ul></font></b></u>
<li><b>Walk off left:</b> occurs when the player character walks off the left edge
of the screen.</li>
<li><b>Walk off right:</b> occurs when the player walks off the right edge of the
screen.</li>
<li><b>Walk off bottom:</b> occurs when the player character walks off the bottom
edge of the screen.</li>
<li><b>Walk off top:</b> occurs when the player character walks off the top edge
of the screen.</li>
<li><b>First time enters screen:</b> occurs the first time the player enters the
room. This event occurs AFTER the screen has faded in, so it allows you to
display a message describing the scene.</li>
<li><b>Player enters screen:</b> occurs just after the room is loaded into memory.
This event occurs every time the player enters the screen, and it happens
BEFORE the screen has faded in, which allows you to change object graphics
and do other things to the screen which the player won't notice.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Do NOT use a &quot;Display message&quot; command with this event, since the
screen hasn't faded in, the message will not be visible.</li>
<li><b>Repeatedly execute:</b> occurs repeatedly on every interpreter cycle. The
normal game speed is 40 cycles per second, so this event occurs about
<br>every 25 milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.1.4 INVENTORY ITEM INTERACTIONS<ul></font></b></u>
<li><b>Look at inventory:</b> occurs when the player clicks on the inventory item
while in the &quot;look&quot; mode.</li>
<li><b>Interact with inventory:</b> (not yet implemented).</li>
<li><b>Speak to inventory:</b> (not yet implemented).</li>
<li><b>Use inventory on inv:</b> occurs when the player uses another inventory
object on this one. You set the Data column to the number of the other item
which needs to be used on this item (see section 6.1.1 above for details
on the way this works). This event allows the player to combine items, and
so on. For example, if they had picked up a laptop computer and a battery,
seperately, then you could use this to allow them to insert the battery into
the computer.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.2 INTERACTION COMMANDS</font></b></u><br><br>
The following commands are available in response to events in Interaction
windows:<ul>
<li><b>Go to screen %d:</b> changes the player character's current room to the %d.
If this is in response to one of the screen edge events, the character will
be placed on the opposite side of the screen. Otherwise, you must use the Data
column to specify where on the new screen the man is placed. You specify which
edge by using these numbers: 1000=left, 2000=right, 3000=bottom, 4000=top.
He will be placed in the middle of that side, unless you add the pixel offset
along the edge, which you can get from the &quot;Ask Position&quot; function in the
Setup Screen mode. For example, Data=2150 would place him near the bottom of
the right-hand side.</li>
<li><b>(Do nothing):</b> nothing happens.</li>
<li><b>Stop man walking:</b> the player character stops moving if he is currently
moving.</li>
<li><b>Character dies:</b> this command is not currently supported, and using it
will generate an error.</li>
<li><b>Run animation %d:</b> runs an animation. Each room has animations numbered
from 1 to 9, so you can have up to 9 animations per room. Click the &quot;...&quot;
button to edit the animation.</li>
<li><b>Display message %d:</b> displays a message. If the number is below 40, then
the room message of that number will be displayed. If the number is above
500, then the relevant global message is displayed.</li>
<li><b>Remove object %d:</b> turns the specified object off. It will no longer
appear on this screen, until it is turned back on by the &quot;Turn object on&quot;
command.</li>
<li><b>Remv obj %d, add inv:</b> turns the specified object off, and adds the
inventory number in the Data column to the player's inventory.</li>
<li><b>Add inventory %d:</b> Adds the specified inventory item to the player's
inventory.</li>
<li><b>Run script:</b> Runs a text script. Click the &quot;...&quot; button to edit the
script. Section 4.4, above, introduces the text script system.</li>
<li><b>Run graphical script:</b> Runs a graphical script. Click the &quot;...&quot; button
to create the script. Section 3.3.3 describes the graphical script.</li>
<li><b>Play sound %d:</b> plays the sound effect SOUNDx.WAV or SOUNDx.VOC, where X
is the number you supply. If the number is &gt;=1000, then this command will
instead change the background music to MUSICx.MID/MOD/XM, where X is the
number you supply minus 1000.</li>
<li><b>Play FLI/FLC %d:</b> plays either FLIC%d.FLC or FLIC%d.FLI. If you set the
Data column to 1 then the player can skip the animation by pressing ESC.
Otherwise, they must watch the whole thing. For information on converting
AVI files to FLC, see section 7.1 .</li>
<li><b>Turn object %d on:</b> turns the specified object on. Either it was
<br>previously turned off using the &quot;Remove object&quot; command, or it was set
to initially Off in the Room Editor.</li>
<li><b>Run dialog topic %d:</b> starts a conversation, using topic number &quot;%d&quot; from
the Dialog Editor.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.3 TEXT SCRIPT FUNCTIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
<br><font color=#a00000><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b></font> Most of the script functions are non-blocking: that is, they
return control immediately to the script, and then the function will be
performed while the game continues. However, a few of the functions, such
as &quot;Display&quot;, are blocking. In this case, the script does not continue until
the function has finished (in this example, the user has removed the message
box). Blocking functions are documented as such below.
<br><br>The following functions are available in the text script system. In
alphabetical order:<ul>
<li><b>AddInventory (int what)</b>
<br>  Adds inventory index WHAT to the current player character's inventory. This
  is the same as doing  character[EGO].inv[WHAT]+=1;   It is possibly useful
  in a game where the player can control more than one character, since it
  will add the inventory to the current player character.
  SeeAlso: LoseInventory
<li><b>AnimateCharacter (int charid, int loop, int speed, int repeat)</b>
<br>  Starts character CHARID animating. See the description for AnimateObject for
  more details, as this command is identical to AnimateObject except it works
  with characters. If the character is moving it will be stopped.
  SeeAlso: AnimateObject, SetCharacterView
<li><b>AnimateObject (int object, int loop, int speed, int repeat)</b>
<br>  Starts the object number OBJECT animating, using loop number LOOP of its
  current view. The overall speed of the animation is set with SPEED,
  where 0 is the fastest, and increasing numbers mean slower. The delay for
  each frame is worked out as SPEED + FRAME SPD, so the individual frame
  speeds are relative to this overall speed.
  The REPEAT parameter sets whether the animation will continuously repeat
  the cycling through the frames. If REPEAT is zero, the animation will start
  from the first frame of LOOP, and go through each frame in turn until the
  last frame, where it will stop. If REPEAT is 1, when the last frame is
  reached, it will go back to the first frame and start over again with the
  animation. If REPEAT is 2, it will do the animation once, but then return
  the graphic to the first frame and stop (whereas repeat=0 will leave the
  graphic on the last frame).
<br>  SeeAlso: AnimateCharacter, SetObjectView
<li><b>AreCharObjColliding (int charid, int obj)</b>
<br>  Checks if character CHARID and object OBJ are touching each other.
  Returns 1 if they are, and 0 if they are not.
  <br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function checks the character's feet against the whole of the
  object. This is used to see if the character is standing on an object, and
  so on. The top two-thirds of the character do not trigger.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function only performs a rectangular check, even when pixel-
  perfect click detection is on.
<li><b>AreObjectsColliding (int obj1, int obj2)</b>
<br>  Checks if object OBJ1 and OBJ2 are touching each other. Returns 1 if they
  are, and 0 if they are not.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function only performs a rectangular check, even when pixel-
  perfect click detection is turned on.
<li><b>CapturedPrint (int x, int y, string text, ...)</b>
  This command is similar to the &quot;Display&quot; command except that it only works
  while the screen is captured, and it does not wrap the text. The specified
  text is printed at co-ordinates (X,Y). Unlike the Display command, the text
  remains on-screen and does not wait for a keypress to remove it. This allows
  you to display multiple messages at once while the screen is captured.
<br>  SeeAlso: CaptureScreen, Display
<li><b>CaptureScreen (int colour)</b>
<br>  Sets up the screen so that the script has complete control over what is
  displayed. This is useful for screens like the QFG series statistics screen,
  where you want to display information to the player. COLOUR is the colour
  index with which the screen will be cleared. You can find out the colour of
  the various colours by using the Palette Manager in the Room Editor.
  While the screen is captured, all interfaces are disabled. You can use
  the &quot;on_mouse_click&quot; and &quot;on_key_press&quot; functions to call EndCapture to
  release the screen.
<br>  SeeAlso: CapturedPrint, EndCapture
<li><b>CDAudio (int command, int param)</b>
<br>  This function allows you to play and control an audio CD in your game.
  Different tasks are performed, depending on the value of the COMMAND
  parameter. If there is no CD-ROM drive on the system, the function does
  nothing.
<br>  The PARAM parameter is used by some of the functions for various reasons; if
  it is not needed for the particular function you are calling, pass zero
  instead.
  The tasks performed are as follows depending on the COMMAND parameter:
<br>     <b>0 - Query CD-ROM support</b> checks if there is a CD-ROM drive available on
        the system. Returns 1 if there is, and 0 if there is not.
<br>     <b>1 -  Get playing status</b> checks whether the CD drive is currently playing
        an audio track. Returns 1 if it is, and 0 if it is not.
<br>     <b>2 -  Play track</b> starts playback from track PARAM on the CD. If the track
        does not exist, or if it is a data track, nothing happens.
<br>     <b>3 - Pause playback</b> pauses the currently playing audio track.
<br>    <b>4 - Resume playback</b> continues from where the track was paused.
<br>    <b>5 - Get number of tracks</b> returns the number of tracks on the CD
        currently in the drive. If the drive is empty, returns 0.
<br>     <b>6 - Eject</b> ejects the drive tray if the drive has the ability. This is
        a feature you'll play with to start off because it's neat, and then
        realize that it has no real use in your game.
        Your script does not continue until the drive is fully ejected.
<br>     <b>7 - Close tray</b> the reverse of Eject. This will pull the drive tray back
        in again. Your script does not continue until the drive has been
        fully closed.
<br>     <b>8 - Get number of CD-ROM drives</b> returns the number of CD drives in the
        system, normally 1.
<br>     <b>9 - Select current CD-ROM drive</b> changes the current CD drive to PARAM,
        where PARAM ranges from 1 to (number of CD drives). All the other
        CD Audio functions operate on the current CD drive.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> These CD Audio functions are slow compared to all the other script
  functions. This will not be noticeable if you call them from most scripts,
  but using CDAudio in a repeatedly_execute script will noticeably slow down
  the game.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> If the game is run under plain MS-DOS, the user's CD-ROM driver will
  need to be loaded in memory for these functions to work. If it is not, the
  game assumes that there is no CD-ROM drive on the system.
<li><b>ChangeCharacterView (int charid, int newview)</b>
<br>  Changes the normal view number of character CHARID to NEWVIEW. This is
  useful if, for example, you want the character to change the clothes
  they are wearing, and so permanently alter their view number.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetCharacterView
<li><b>CyclePalette (int start, int end)</b>
<br>  This is used for special effects, like the flowing colours on the Space
  Quest 4 title screen, and the Sierra logo of the later Sierra games.
  The palette indexes from START to END are cycled around one slot. Using
  this call in a repeatedly_execute function gives the effect of animation.
<br>  SeeAlso: FadeIn, FadeOut, SetPalRGB
<li><b>Debug (int command, int reserved)</b>
<br>  This function provides all the debug services in the system. It performs
  various different tasks, depending on the value of the COMMAND parameter.
  If debug mode is off, then this function does nothing. This allows you to
  leave your script unaltered when you distribute your game, so you just have
  to turn off debug mode in the Room Editor.
  The RESERVED parameter is currently unused and you should always pass 0.
  All the valid values for the COMMAND parameter are listed below along with
  what they do:
<br>    <b>0 -  All inventory</b> gives the current player character one of every
        inventory item. This is useful for testing so that you don't have to
        go and pick up items every time you test part of the game where they
        are required.
<br>    <b>1 -  Display interpreter version</b> the engine will display its version
        number and build date.
<br>    <b>2 -  Walkable from here</b> fills in the parts of the screen where the player
        can walk from their current location. This is useful if you think the
        path-finder is not working properly. Yellow areas are where the man
        can walk. Blue areas are defined as walkable in the Room Editor, but
        he cannot get to them from his current position. The unaltered parts
        of the screen are not walkable.
<br>    <b>3 -  Teleport</b> displays a dialog box asking for what room you want to go
        to, and then calls NewRoom to teleport you there. Useful for skipping
        parts of the game or going to a specific point to test something.
<li><b>DisableCursorMode (int mode)</b>
<br>  Disables the mouse cursor MODE. Any attempts to set the cursor to this mode
  while it is disabled (like using SetMouseCursor) will fail. This function
  also greys out and disables any interface buttons whose left-click command
  is set as &quot;Set mode X&quot;, where X is equal to MODE.
  If the current cursor mode is MODE, then the engine will change it to the
  next enabled standard cursor.
<br>  SeeAlso: EnableCursorMode
<li><b>DisableInterface ()</b>
<br>  Disables the player interface. This works the same way as it is disabled
  while an animation is running: the mouse cursor is changed to the Wait
  cursor, and mouse clicks will not be sent through to the &quot;on_mouse_click&quot;
  function. Also, all interface buttons will be disabled.
<br>  SeeAlso: EnableInterface
<li><b>Display (string message, ...)</b>
<br>  Displays a message to the screen. It will be displayed in the standard
  message box, and centred in the middle of the screen. You can insert the
  values of variables using &quot;%d&quot; and &quot;%s&quot; in the message. To insert the value
  of an integer variable, use %d, to insert a string use %s. For example,<br>
  Display (&quot;The counter is currently set to %d.&quot;, my_counter);
<br>  This will replace the '%d' with the value of the variable &quot;my_counter&quot;.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Display is a blocking function - that is, control will not return
  to the script until the player has removed the text window (by pressing a
  key or clicking the mouse). While the window is displayed, all other
  processing, like animations and interface display, are disabled. This is
  usually used for responses to the player LOOKing at things.
<br>  SeeAlso: DisplayAt, DisplayMessage, DisplaySpeech
<li><b>DisplayAt(int x, int y, int width, string message, ...)</b>
<br>  Identical to the &quot;Display&quot; function, only this allows you to define the
  position and size of the window where the text is displayed. The X and Y
  variables define the co-ordinates of the upper-left corner of the window.
  The WIDTH variable defines the width of the window. The height is then
  automatically calculated so that the message fits into the window.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This is a blocking call. See the &quot;Display&quot; help for more information.
<br>  SeeAlso: Display
<li><b>DisplayMessage (int message_number)</b>
<br>  Identical to the Display function, but this uses a message text defined in
  the Room Editor rather than in the script. It will either use a message
  from the current room, or a global message (if message_number &gt;= 500).
<br>  SeeAlso: Display
<li><b>DisplaySpeech (int charid, string message)</B>
<br>  Displays the text MESSAGE as speech above the specified character's head.
  The text will remain on screen for a limited time, and the user may or may
  not be able to click it away depending on the setting of &quot;Player can't
  skip speech text&quot;. The text displayed by this function looks identical to
  that used by the dialog system.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function does not allow variables like &quot;%d&quot; and &quot;%s&quot; in the
  message.
<br>  SeeAlso: Display
<li><b>EnableCursorMode (int mode)</b>
<br>  Re-enables the mouse cursor mode MODE. This function also enables any
  interface buttons which were disabled by the DisableCursorMode command.
<br>  SeeAlso: DisableCursorMode
<li><b>EnableInterface ()</b>
<br>  Re-enables the player interface, which was previously disabled with
  the DisableInterface function. Everything which was disabled is returned
  to normal.
<br>  SeeAlso: DisableInterface
<li><b>EndCapture()</b>
<br>  Ends the script's control over the screen and restores what was there
  previously.
<br>  SeeAlso: CaptureScreen
<li><b>FaceCharacter (int charid, int tofaceid)</b>
<br>  Turns the graphic of character CHARID so that it looks like he is facing
  character TOFACEID. This involves changing the current loop of CHARID
  to the appropriate loop number, and setting the frame number to 0 (standing).
<br>  SeeAlso: FaceLocation, MoveCharacter
<li><b>FaceLocation (int charid, int x, int y)</b>
<br>  Similar to the FaceCharacter function, except that this faces the character
  to screen location (X,Y). This allows him to face not only other characters,
  but also objects and hotspots as well (you can get their co-ordinates from
  the Ask Position feature in the Room Editor).
<br>  SeeAlso: FaceCharacter
<li><b>FadeIn (int speed)</B>
<br>  Fades in from a black screen to the current palette. This is used to restore
  the screen after a FadeOut call. SPEED is from 1 (slowest) to 64 (fastest).
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This is a blocking function.
<br>  SeeAlso: CyclePalette, FadeOut
<li><b>FadeOut (int speed)</b>
<br>  Fades the screen out to black. SPEED is the speed of the fade, from 1
  (slowest) to 64 (instant). You can restore the screen with FadeIn.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This is a blocking function.
<br>  SeeAlso: CyclePalette, FadeIn
<li><b>FileClose (int handle)</B>
<br>  Closes the file with handle HANDLE, and commits all changes to disk.
  You MUST close the file after you have finished with it.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileOpen
<li><b>FileOpen (string filename, int mode)</b>
<br>  Opens a disk file for reading or writing. These disk I/O functions are only
  intended for simple tasks like the way the QFG series export the character
  when you complete it. MODE is either FILE_READ or FILE_WRITE, depending on
  whether you want to write to or read from the file. If you pass FILE_WRITE
  and a file called FILENAME already exists, it will be overwritten.
  This function returns a file handle, which you use in future calls to
  file functions, or returns 0 if there was a problem (eg. file not existing
  when MODE is FILE_READ).
<br>  Example (of writing a file):
<br>    int handle = FileOpen (&quot;temp.tmp&quot;, FILE_WRITE);
<br>    if (handle == 0) Display(&quot;Error opening file.&quot;);
<br>    else {
<br>      FileWrite (handle, &quot;test string&quot;);
<br>      FileClose (handle);
<br>      }
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>IMPORTANT:</b></font> If you want to include a path as well as filename, you MUST use
  forward slashes '/' and NOT back-slashes '\'. Using back-slashes may cause
  the program to crash when it tries to compile your script. For example,
  use this: &quot;c:/temp/myfile.tmp&quot; instead of this: &quot;c:\temp\myfile.tmp&quot;.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileClose, FileRead, FileWrite
<li><b>FileRead (int handle, string buffer)</b>
<br>  Reads a string into BUFFER, from a file previously opened with FileOpen
  which returned HANDLE. You should only use this with files which you
  previously wrote out with FileWrite. Do NOT use this function with any
  other files, even text files.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileOpen, FileWrite
<li><b>FileReadInt (int handle)</b>
<br>  Reads an integer from the file HANDLE, and returns it to the script.
  Only integers written with FileWriteInt can be read back.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileRead, FileWriteInt
<li><b>FileWrite (int handle, string text)</b>
<br>  Writes TEXT to the file HANDLE, which must have been previously opened
  with FileOpen for writing. The string is written using a custom format to
  the file, which can only be read back by using FileRead.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileRead, FileOpen
<li><b>FileWriteInt (int handle, int value)</b>
<br>  Writes VALUE to the file HANDLE. This allows you to save the contents of
  variables to disk. The file must have been previously opened with FileOpen,
  and you can read the value back later with FileReadInt.
<br>  SeeAlso: FileReadInt, FileWrite
<li><b>GetCurrentMusic()</b>
<br>  Returns the number of the currently playing background music, or</b>1 if
  no music is playing.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetMusicRepeat, SetMusicVolume
<li><b>GetCursorMode()</B>
<br>  Returns the value of the current mode of the cursor. This is either
  MODE_LOOK, MODE_USE, MODE_TALK or any custom modes you have created.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetCursorMode
<li><b>GetGlobalInt (int index)</b>
<br>  Returns the value of global variable INDEX.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetGlobalInt
<li><b>GetInvName (int item, string buffer)</b>
<br>  Fills in BUFFER with the name of inventory item index ITEM. This is the
  name which the item is given under the Game tab, Inventory mode of the Room
  Editor.
  This function is mainly useful for a lucasarts-style status line:
<br>   GetInvName (player.activeinv, buffer);
<br>  SeeAlso: GetLocationName
<li><b>GetLanguageString (int index, string buffer)</b>
<br>  Reads the language text string INDEX into BUFFER. The <b>AGS</b> language
  definition files consist of a collection of numbered strings with various
  system text in a particular language. Whenever possible, you should use
  this function rather than putting text directly into your script file, as
  it gives flexibility and multilingual support.
  For example, if you wanted to display a message &quot;Do you want to see the
  intro?&quot;, you should check the message file, and find that message 300
  reads &quot;Do you want to watch the introduction?&quot;. In this case, you should
  then use GetLanguageString(300,buffer) rather than using your text directly.
  You can add your own custom strings to the message files by using message
  numbers of 500 and above.
<li><b>GetLocationName (int x, int y, string buffer)</b>
<br>  Fills in BUFFER with the name of whatever is on the screen at (X,Y). This
  allows you to create the Lucasarts-style status lines reading &quot;Look at xxx&quot;
  as the player moves the cursor over them.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The co-ordinates are SCREEN co-ordinates, NOT ROOM co-ordinates. This
  means that with a scrolling room, the co-ordinates you pass are relative to
  the screen's current position, and NOT absolute room co-ordinates. This
  means that this function is suitable for use with the mouse cursor position
  variables.
<br>  For example,  GetLocationName(mouse.x, mouse.y, buffer);
<br>  SeeAlso: GetInvName
<li><b>GetPalette (palette saveto)</b>
<br>  Saves the current palette to SAVETO. There is a new variable type called
  &quot;palette&quot;, which you should create an instance of before calling this
  function. After calling it, you can use .r, .g and .b to access the
  components. For example,
<br>   palette mypal;
<br>   GetPalette (mypal);
<br>   Display(&quot;Colour 15's green component is %d&quot;, mypal[15].g );
<br>  SeeAlso: SetPalette
<li><b>GetPlayerCharacter()</b>
<br>  Returns the current character which the player is controlling.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetPlayerCharacter
<li><b>GiveScore (int score)</b>
<br>  Adds SCORE to the player's score. This is preferable to directly modifying
  the variable since it will play the score sound and make sure that the
  status line is updated. Note that SCORE can be negative, in which case the
  score sound is NOT played.
<li><b>InterfaceOff (int interface)</b>
<br>  Turns interface element number INTERFACE off. It will no longer appear on
  the screen (or, if it is a pop-up interface, it cannot be popped up).
<br>  SeeAlso: InterfaceOn
<li><b>InterfaceOn (int interface)</b>
<br>  Turns interface element number INTERFACE on and displays it on the screen.
  This can be used to display a previously turned off interface, or to bring
  up a special interface like an inventory window.
  If the specified interface is a script-only interface (set to &quot;On script
  command&quot; in the Room Editor), then the game will be paused while the
  interface is displayed, and you should use InterfaceOff as a reaction to
  a button click in the interface to remove it.
<br>  SeeAlso: InterfaceOff, IsGamePaused
<li><b>InventoryScreen ()</b>
<br>  Brings up the Sierra-style inventory window which allows the player to
  select and manipulate inventory items. If they select one, the cursor mode
  will be set to inventory-use (mode 4), and  character[EGO].activeinv  will
  be set to the inventory item selected.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function does not actually bring up the window immediately;
  instead, it will show the window when the current script function finishes
  executing.
<li><b>IsGamePaused ()</b>
<br>  Returns 1 if the game is currently paused, or 0 otherwise.
  The game is paused when either the icon bar interface has been popped up,
  or a &quot;script-only&quot; interface has been displayed with InterfaceOn. While
  the game is paused, no animations or other updates take place.
<br>  SeeAlso: InterfaceOn
<li><b>LoseInventory (int what)</b>
<br>  Removes inventory item WHAT from the current player character's inventory.
  If they do not have the item, nothing happens.
<br>  SeeAlso: AddInventory
<li><B>MoveCharacter (int charid, int x, int y)</b>
<br>  Moves the character CHARID from its current location to X,Y. CHARID can
  be either the character's number (as GetPlayerCharacter returns) or its ID
  set in the Room Editor. If the character cannot get to X,Y it will be moved
  as close as possible.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> this function only works with characters which are on the current
 screen.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> if you need to find out when the character has reached its destination,
 use the  character[charid].walking  variable. See the variables section below
  for more information.
<br>  SeeAlso: FaceCharacter, MoveCharacterToObject, MoveObject, StopMoving
<li><b>MoveCharacterDirect (int charid, int x, int y)</b>
<br>  Moves the character CHARID from its current location to (X,Y) directly,
  ignoring walkable areas on the screen. This is identical to the &quot;Move to,
  ignore walls&quot; animation command.
<br>  SeeAlso: MoveCharacter
<li><b>MoveCharacterToHotspot (int charid, int hotspot)</b>
<br>  Moves the character CHARID from its current location to the walk-to point
  for the specified hotspot. If the hotspot has no walk-to point, nothing
  happens.
  This is a blocking call - control is not returned to the script until the
  character has reached its destination.
<br>  SeeAlso: MoveCharacter, MoveCharacterToObject
<li><b>MoveCharacterToObject (int charid, int object)</b>
<br>  Moves the character CHARID from its current location to a position just below
  the object OBJECT. This is useful for example, if you want the man to pick
  up an object. Example:
<br>    MoveCharacterToObject (EGO, 0);
<br>    ObjectOff (0);
<br>    AddInventory (3);
<br>  This is a blocking call - control is not returned to the script until the
  character has reached its destination.
<br>  SeeAlso: MoveCharacter, MoveCharacterToHotspot
<br>MoveObject (int object, int x, int y, int speed)
<br>  Starts the object OBJECT moving from its current location to (X,Y). It will
  move at speed SPEED, which uses the same scale as the character Walk Speed
  values in the Room Editor.
<br>  SeeAlso: MoveCharacter
<li><b>NewRoom (int room_number)</b>
<br>  Changes the room the player is in. This command unloads the current room
  from memory and loads instead ROOMx.CRM, where X is room_number.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>  IMPORTANT:</b></font> This command does not change the room immediately; instead, it
  will perform the actual room change once your script function has finished
  (This is to avoid problems with unloading the script while it is still
  running). This means that you should not use any other commands which rely
  on the new room (object positionings, and so on) after this command within
  the same function.
<br>  SeeAlso: NewRoomEx
<li><b>NewRoomEx (int room_number, int x, int y)</b>
<br>  Identical to NewRoom, except that the player character is placed at
  co-ordinates (X,Y) in the new room.
<br>  SeeAlso: NewRoom
<li><b>ObjectOff (int object)</b>
<br>  Turns object number OBJECT off. It will no longer be displayed in this room
  until you use an ObjectOn command.
<li><b>ObjectOn (int object)</b>
<br>  Turns object number OBJECT on. It may have been turned off previously with
>  ObjectOff or may have been set initially off in RoomEdit.
<li><b>PauseGame ()</b>
<br>  Stops the engine processing character movement and animation, and other
  game features. This has the same effect on the game as happens when a
  script-only interface is popped up. The processing will not resume until
  you call the UnPauseGame function.
<br>  SeeAlso: UnPauseGame
<li><b>PlayFlic (int flic_number, int can_skip_flag)</b>
<br>  Plays a FLI or FLC animation. The game checks for FLICx.FLC and FLICx.FLI
  (where X is FLIC_NUMBER) and if it finds one, plays it. If CAN_SKIP_FLAG
  is 1, the player can press ESC to skip the animation. Otherwise, they must
  watch the whole thing. This is identical to the room interaction command
  &quot;Play FLI/FLC %d&quot;. The game is paused while the animation plays.
<li><b>PlayMusic (int music_number)</b>
<br>  Changes the currently playing background music to MUSICx.MID, MUSICx.MOD
  or MUSICx.XM (where X is MUSIC_NUMBER). The game will search for the files
  in that order until it finds one to play.
<br>  SeeAlso: PlaySound
<li><b>PlaySound (int sound_number)</b>
<br>  Plays a WAV or VOC sound effect. The game will search for SOUNDx.VOC
  and SOUNDx.WAV (where x is SOUND_NUMBER) and play it. This is identical to
  the room interaction command &quot;Play sound %d&quot;.
<br>  SeeAlso: PlayMusic
<li><b>ProcessClick (int x, int y, int mode)</b>
<br>  Simulates clicking the mouse on the location (X,Y) on the screen, in the
  cursor mode MODE. Any conditions attached will be executed. For example,
<br>  ProcessClick (100, 50, MODE_LOOK);
  will simulate clicking the mouse on co-ordinates (100,50) in the Look mode.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function ignores all interfaces and acts as though the point is
  directly visible. In other words, if the co-ordinates you pass happen to
  lie on a button on an interface, what actually happens will be as if the
  user clicked behind the interface onto the actual screen.
<li><b>QuitGame(int ask_first)</b>
<br>  Exits the game and returns to the operating system (DOS, Windows, etc).
  If ASK_FIRST is zero, it will exit immediately. If ASK_FIRST is not zero,
  it will first display a message box asking the user if they are sure they
  want to quit.
<li><b>Random (int max)</b>
<br>  Returns a random number between 0 and MAX. This function is provided in
  the hope that someone might find it useful - I can't think of anything to
  use it for.
<li><b>RefreshMouse ()</b>
<br>  Updates the global variables &quot;mouse.x&quot; and &quot;mouse.y&quot; with the current
  position of the mouse. Normally, these variables are set just before each
  script function is executed. However, if you have a very long script where
  the mouse may have moved since the start of the function, and you need the
  exact current location, then RefreshMouse will update the variables.
<li><b>ReleaseCharacterView (int charid)</b>
<br>  Allows the engine to automatically control the character's view, as normal.
  Use this once you have finished doing the animation which you started with
  the SetCharacterView command.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetCharacterView
<li><b>RestartGame ()</b>
<br>  Restarts the game from the beginning.
<li><b>RestoreGameDialog ()</b>
<br>  Displays the restore game dialog, where the player can select a previously
  saved game position to restore.
  The dialog is not displayed immediately; instead, it will be displayed when
  the script function finishes executing.
<br>  SeeAlso: SaveGameDialog
<li><b>RunDialog (int topic)</b>
<br>  Starts a conversation using topic number TOPIC. This is identical to the
  &quot;Run dialog topic %d&quot; room interaction command.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The conversation will not start immediately; instead, it will be run
  when the current script function finishes executing.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetDialogOption
<li><b>SaveGameDialog ()</b>
<br>  Displays the save game dialog, where the player can save their current
  game position. If they select to save, then the game position will be saved.
<br>  SeeAlso: RestoreGameDialog
<li><b>SaveScreenShot (string filename)</b>
<br>  Takes a screen capture and saves it to disk. The FILENAME must end in
  either &quot;.BMP&quot; or &quot;.PCX&quot;, as those are the types of files which can be saved.
  Returns 1 if the shot was successfully saved, or 0 if an invalid file
  extension was provided. For example,<br>   SaveScreenShot(&quot;capture.bmp&quot;);
<li><b>SetBackgroundFrame (int frame)</b>
<br>  Locks the background to frame number FRAME of an animating-background
  screen. (Values for FRAME are from 0 to 4). This allows you to use the
  animating backgrounds feature for another purpose - you can have two
  frames of the background, one for example with a spaceship crashed on it.
  Then, once the right event has happened, call SetBackgroundFrame in the
  Player Enters Screen event to set the background before the screen fades in.
  Call SetBackgroundFrame(-1) to set the default animating frames.
  The frame lock is released when the game changes rooms.
<li><b>SetCharacterView (int charid, int view)</b>
<br>  Sets character CHARID's view to VIEW. This can be used to perform animations
  with charaters, for example bending down to pick something up, which don't
  use the default view.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function locks the character's view to the specified view, so
  that it can only be changed by other script commands (ie. it won't
  automatically be changed by the program on shadow areas, screen changes,
  etc). When you are done with the animation, call ReleaseCharacterView to
  allow the program to take control back.
<br>  SeeAlso: AnimateCharacter, ChangeCharacterView, ReleaseCharacterView
<li><b>SetCursorMode(int new_mode)</b>
<br>  Changes the mouse cursor mode to NEW_MODE. The number you pass can be
  obtained from the VISUAL&gt;CURSORS tab of the Room Editor. This function
  changes both the appearance of the cursor and the mode used if the player
  clicks on a hotspot.
<br>  SeeAlso: GetCursorMode, SetMouseCursor
<li><b>SetDefaultCursor()</b>
<br>  Changes the appearance of the mouse cursor to the default for the current
  cursor mode. Use this to restore the cursor picture after you changed it
  with the SetMouseCursor function.
<li><b>SetDialogOption (int topic, int option, int new_state)</b>
<br>  Changes whether an option in a conversation is available to the player or
  not. This allows you to add extra options to a conversation once the player
  has done certain things.
  TOPIC is the topic number, from 0 to the number of topics - 1. Find this
  out in the Room Editor.
  OPTION is the option number within that topic, from 1 to whatever the
  highest option is for that topic.
  NEW_STATE controls what happens to this option. It can have the following
  values:
<br>    <b>0 -  The option is disabled</b> the player will not see it
<br>    <b>1 -  The option is enabled</b> the player can now see and use it
<br>    <b>2 -  The option is permanently disabled</b> no other command can ever turn
        it back on again.
  These are equivalent to the option-off, option-on, and option-off-forever
  dialog commands.
<br>  SeeAlso: RunDialog
<li><b>SetGameSpeed (int new_speed)</b>
<br>  Sets the game speed to NEW_SPEED frames per second, or as near as possible
  to that speed. The default frame rate is 40 fps, but you can speed up or
  slow down the game by using this function. Note that this speed is also the
  rate at which the Repeatedly_Execute functions are triggered.
  The NEW_SPEED must lie between 10 and 100. If it does not, it will be rounded
  to 10 or 100. Note that if you set a speed which the player's computer cannot
  handle (for example, a 486 will not be able to manage 80 fps), then it will
  go as fast as possible.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Because the mouse cursor is repainted at the game frame rate, at very
  low speeds, like 10 to 20 fps, the mouse will appear to be jumpy and not
  very responsive.
<li><b>SetGlobalInt (int index, int value)</b>
<br>  Sets the global variable INDEX to VALUE. You can then retrieve this value
  from any other script using GetGlobalInt.
  There are 100 available global variables, from index 0 to 99.
<br>  SeeAlso: GetGlobalInt
<li><b>SetLabelText (int gui, int object, string newtext)</b>
<br>  Changes the text displayed in the specified label to NEWTEXT. The affected
  label will be object OBJECT from GUI. You can find out a label's object
  number by looking at the Properties window of the label.
  This command allows you to change the text during the game, for example
  to create a Lucasarts-style status line.
<li><b>SetMouseCursor(int new_cursor)</b>
<br>  Changes the appearance of the mouse cursor to NEW_CURSOR. Unlike
  the SetCursorMode function (see above), this does not change the mode
  used if the user clicks on a hotspot. This is useful for displaying a &quot;wait&quot;
  cursor temporarily.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetCursorMode, SetDefaultCursor
<li><b>SetMusicRepeat (int loopflag)</b>
<br>  Tells the system whether to repeat background music tracks. LOOPFLAG is
  either 1 (repeat, default) or 0 (don't repeat).
<br>  SeeAlso: SetMusicVolume
<li><b>SetMusicVolume (int volume)</b>
<br>  Overrides the room volume setting and sets the volume to VOLUME instead.
  The values range from 1 to 5, representing each stage in the RoomEdit
  volume options (ie. 1=quietest, 5=loudest).
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The volume will be reset when the player enters a new room.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetMusicRepeat, GetCurrentMusic
<li><b>SetObjectFrame (int object, int view, int loop, int frame)</b>
<br>  Sets object number OBJECT's graphic to frame FRAME of loop LOOP of view
  number VIEW. This is useful if you want the object to use the second loop
  in a view for an animation, because using the SetObjectView function in
  room startup code will cause loop 0 to breifly flash on the screen first.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetObjectView
<li><b>SetObjectGraphic (int object, int slot)</b>
<br>  Sets the graphic for object number OBJECT to slot number SLOT. You can get
  the slot number from the Sprite Manager in RoomEdit. If the object is
  currently animating (from an AnimateObject command) then the animation will
  be stopped.
<br>  SeeAlso: SetObjectFrame, SetObjectView
<li><b>SetObjectPosition (int object, int x, int y)</b>
<br>  Changes the object number OBJECT's position to (X,Y). These co-ordinates
  specify the lower-left hand corner of the object.
<li><b>SetObjectView (int object, int view)</b>
<br>  Sets object number OBJECT's view to VIEW. The graphic is set to the first
  frame of loop 0 of the view.
<br>  SeeAlso: AnimateObject, SetObjectFrame
<li><b>SetPalette (palette newpal)</b>
<br>  Replaces the entire palette with NEWPAL. You can build the palette yourself
  using the script, or you can use GetPalette and then modify one or two
  palette slots.
<br>  SeeAlso: GetPalette, SetPalRGB
<li><b>SetPalRGB (int slot, int red, int green, int blue)</b>
<br>  Changes the RGB components of one of the palette slots. The palette is
  initially set up in RoomEdit, but you can override it during the game using
  this function for special effects. The RED, GREEN and BLUE parameters each
  range from 0 to 63 (as used in the Palette Editor).
  If SLOT is a background slot, then this function's effect will last until
  the player changes screen, when the palette is changed to the new room's
  palette. If SLOT is not a background slot, the effect of this function is
  permanent.
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> This function will allow you to change the colours which are &quot;locked&quot;
  in the Room Editor. However, you should not normally do this as it can
  cause strange colours in the game.
<br>  SeeAlso: CyclePalette, FadeIn, FadeOut, SetPalette
<li><b>SetPlayerCharacter (int char_id)</b>
<br>  Changes the character which the player controls to CHAR_ID. You can either
  use the character's number, or the ID string set in the Room Editor.
  This function will also cause the room to change to the room which the
  chosen character is currently in. (It calls NewRoom with the character's
 room, so the change won't happen until the end of the script).
<br>  <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The &quot;player&quot; global variable is not updated with the new character;
  so using &quot;player.x&quot;, &quot;player.name&quot; and so on will change the original
  character, not the current player character.
<br>  SeeAlso: GetPlayerCharacter, NewRoom
<li><b>StopMoving (int charid)</b>
<br>  Stops the character CHARID moving and sets its graphic to the standing frame
  of the current loop.
<br>  SeeAlso: MoveCharacter
<li><b>StrCat (string str1, string str2)</b>
<br>  Appends STR2 to the end of STR1. For example, if STR1 contains &quot;Hello&quot;
  and STR2 contains &quot;world&quot;, then after this function has been called, STR1
  will contain &quot;Helloworld&quot;.
<li><b>StrComp (string str1, string str2)</b>
<br>  Compares the strings STR1 and STR2. Returns zero if they are identical, and
  non-zero if they are not.
<li><b>StrCopy (string str1, string str2)</b>
<br>  Copies the contents of STR2 into STR1, overwriting STR1's original contents.
  Use this instead of the assignment STR1=STR2 .
<li><b>StrLen (string str1)</b>
<br>  Returns the length, in characters, of the string STR1.
<li><b>UnPauseGame ()</b>
<br>  Resumes the game.
<br>  SeeAlso: PauseGame
<li><b>Wait (int time)</b>
<br>  Pauses the script and lets the game continue for TIME loops. There are
  normally 40 loops/second (unless you change it with SetGameSpeed), so using
 a value of 80 will wait 2 seconds. Note that no other text scripts can
  run while the Wait function is in the background.</ul>

<b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>The character X &amp; Y co-ordinates may be modified as long as the character
  is stationary; changing these while the character is moving will cause it
  to start moving off in the wrong direction.
<li>The system information is provided in order for your game to behave
  differently if it needs to; however, do NOT use this information to force
  the player to use a specific resolution. The AC engine is designed to allow
  players with varying speeds of computer to enjoy the game at a playable
  speed; people with a 486 would rather see blocky graphics at 320x200 than
  be forced to run very slowly at 640x400.

<font color=#00a000><b><u>6.7 GRAPHICAL SCRIPT COMMAND REFERENCE</font></b></u><br><br>
While many of the graphical script commands mirror the behavior of the
standard Interaction commands with the same name, there are some extra
commands special to the graphical script:<ul>
<li><b>Clear flag FLAGNAME</b>
<br>Sets the flag's state to &quot;Clear&quot;.</li>
<li><b>Every XX loops</b>
<br>The indented commands are carried out once every XX game loops. There are
approximately 50 game loops per second, so specifing '50' will mean that
the commands will be carried out once a second. This is only useful with
the &quot;repeatedly execute&quot; room event.</li>
<li><b>If flag FLAGNAME is set</b>
<br>The indented commands are only carried out if the specified flag is
in its &quot;Set&quot; state.</li>
<li><b>If flag FLAGNAME is clear</b>
<br>The indented commands are only carried out if the flag is in its &quot;Clear&quot;
state.</li>
<li><b>If inventory XX was used</b>
<br>The indented commands are carried out if the player used inventory item XX
to cause the event. You use this with the ability to set Data column to 99
on a &quot;Use inv&quot; event (see section 6.1.1 for information).</li>
<li><b>If player has inv XX</b>
<br>The indented commands are only carried out if the player has the specified
inventory item.</li>
<li><b>If timer expired</B>
<br>The indented commands are carried out if XX loops have passed since
the &quot;Set timer&quot; command was executed. (See &quot;set timer&quot;).
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> There is only one timer, and it is global. That is, starting the
timer on one screen can trigger an &quot;if expired&quot; event on another screen
if the player changes screens before the timer expires.</li>
<li><b>Move man to object XX</b>
<br>Walks the main character to the object number specified. This is a
shortcut for having to create an animation just to move the man up to
the object he is interacting with.
The character is moved to 5 pixels below the bottom of the object.</li>
<li><b>Random chance 1 in XX</b>
<br>Probably only useful with the &quot;repeatedly execute&quot; event, the indented
commands will be carried out if a random number selection by the game
turns out. For example, if XX is 3, the command will probably be carried
out about once every three times the script is executed, but this isn't
gauranteed. This is useful for things like adding a flying bird to the
screen which would appear at random intervals while the player was on the
screen.</li>
<li><b>Set flag FLAGNAME</b>
<br>Sets the specified flag's state to &quot;Set&quot;.</li>
<li><b>Set timer to XX loops</b>
<br>Starts the user timer counting down from XX - that is, the timer will
expire after XX loops. (See &quot;If timer expired&quot;). This is similar to the
&quot;Every XX loops&quot; command, except that the timer will expire XX loops FROM
WHEN THIS SET TIMER COMMAND IS EXECUTED. This means that you can set another
event to happen an exact time after this.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Using this command with XX as 0 will deactivate the timer.
<br><font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> The timer will be deactivated if the player leaves the room where it
was activated.</li>
</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>6.8 ANIMATION EDITOR COMMANDS</font></b></u><br><br>
This section describes all the commands available in the Animation Editor.
The editor is explained in section 3.2.6.
<br><br>For all of the commands, you set the Object number to the number of the
object you want the command to operate on (from 0 to number_of_objects), or
you can set it to 99, in which case the command refers to the player
character.
<ul>
<li><b>Set object view to %d</b>
<br>    Changes the view assigned to the object. The '%d' is the number of the
    view, from the status bar in the View Editor. This command also resets
    the object's graphic to the first frame of loop 0 in the chosen view.
    You can use a special view number 0, which is the main character's default
    view. This is useful to put back the main character if you changed his
    graphics during the game.
<li><b> Animate using loop %d</b>
<br>    Starts the object animating using loop number '%d' of its current view.
    The object will cycle through all the frames in the loop and then stop.
    If the Wait column is set, the next command will not be executed until
    the animation has finished.
    If you set the &quot;second value&quot; number to 1 then the animation will repeat
    continuosly. If it is 0 (default) the animation will run once then stop.
<br>    <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> Don't set the Wait column AND set &quot;second value&quot; to 1, or you will
    be waiting a LONG time!
<li><b> Move to %d,%d</b>
<br>    Starts the object moving to the specified co-ordinates. You can find out
    the co-ordinates of a point by using the  Misc | Ask Position  feature
    in RoomMake. If the Wait column is set, the next command will not be
    executed until the object has reached its destination.
<br>    <font color=#a00000><b>NOTE:</b></font> If you specify a target point which cannot be reached, there will
    be a short delay and then the next command will be executed immediately.
<li><b> Move to %d,%d no walls</b>
<br>    Identical to &quot;Move to %d,%d&quot;, except that the object will move in a direct
    path straight to the destination, ignoring all the walls on the screen.
    This is useful if you want to have the man, for instance, walking into a
    door once it's open (which would mean crossing the base of the door,
    presumably a wall to the player). It can also be used to simulate flying
    objects.
<li><b> Place at %d,%d</b>
<br>    Moves the object's position to the location immediately. Note that this
    will only work if the object is turned OFF. Useful with the &quot;player enters
    screen&quot; event to move objects around or to place the main character
    somewhere which isn't on a screen edge.
    Note that the position specified is the BOTTOM LEFT of the object graphic.</ul>

This section is split up into three parts:<ul>
<li>frequently asked questions, which answers questions people have about
the system, rather than problems using it.</li>
<li>run-time engine problems, which deals with problems getting the engine
to run, sound card issues, crashes, and other game-independant problems.</li>

</ul>
<br><font color=#00a000><b><u>7.1 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</font></b></u><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Q.</b> Can I play an AVI file?
<br><b>A.</b> No, not directly. However, you can convert an AVI file for use with the
   program. You've probably noticed that <b>AGS</b> supports WAV files for sound
   effects and FLI/FLC for animations. By using a &quot;Play sound&quot; command straight
   before a &quot;Play FLC&quot; command the sound should be in sync with the animation.
   To split an AVI file into WAV and FLC components, I recommend the excellent
   Smacker tools (<a href="http://www.smacker.com">www.smacker.com</a>) which are free to download and also do
   a VERY good job of reducing true-color AVIs down to 256-colours.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> What is the &quot;Fonts&quot; tab for in the Room Editor?
<br><b>A.</b> It will be used when custom font support is added in a future version.
   For now, it does nothing.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> Are you going to do a Windows port of the engine?
<br><b>A.</b> Yes, it's in progress. There are still some bugs with it but it's catching
   up with the DOS version.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> It's a bit cheap, the way you use MS-DOS EDIT to edit the text scripts.
   Why not have an integrated editor?
<br><b>A.</b> An integrated text editor will probably come soon, but in order to release
   the program as quickly as possible, I felt it best to leave a well-tested,
   reliable editor there instead of delaying the release while I write my own
   text editor. Also, this way you can use your favorite text editor instead by
   copying it to EDIT.EXE in the RoomEdit directory.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> What's the deal with the license? What does it mean in plain English?
<br><b>A.</b> Adventure Game Studio is swap-ware. That means, that if you use and like
   the program, you should send me something in return. This could be a game
   you have made using it, some new graphics, a new translation for the system
   messages, or even money! You don't HAVE to do this though, if you're really
   mean, and I won't hold it against you :-)
   There is one requirement - if you want to SELL a game you make, for profit,
   then you must EITHER (a) send me a copy, or (b) tell me about it, giving me
   a location where I can download the full game.
   Even if you're not selling it, I'd appreciate you telling me about the game
   when you finish it, so that I can add it to the main <b>AGS</b> website Links page.
   In exceptional circumstances, I may even agree to host your game on the AC
   site, but you should really get a web page of your own. It's not hard :-)
<li>
<b>Q.</b> Why the swapware license? Why aren't you charging for it?
<br><b>A.</b> Because I want to. Mainly because if you see a program claiming to create
   adventure games, but charging you a registration of $100 if you want to
   distribute a game, you're not likely even to try it. A few people are doing
   this, for example Twilight Software with their system, but at $40 for a
   single user registration, just to make freeware games with it, that's a sure
   way to make it unpopular. Remember &quot;Klik'n'play&quot;? Hmmm.....
<li>
<b>Q.</b> Why are you now distributing <b>AGS</b> with an Install program, instead of just
   letting us unzip it directly?
<br><b>A.</b> Well actually, I'm not any more, because the installer had bugs in... never
   mind. Just make sure you use the &quot;-d&quot; option of PKUNZIP when you unzip it.
</ul><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>7.2 RUN-TIME ENGINE PROBLEMS</font></b></u><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Q.</b> The engine quits with &quot;Aborting due to signal SIGxxxx, Shutting down
   allegro&quot; and a load of numbers. What's going on?
<br><b>A.</b> You may have found a bug in the engine. First of all, check that you
   haven't done anything silly, like assigning a view number to an object
   where the view doesn't exist.
   Otherwise, try and work out when the problem happens - does it always
   happen at the same time (like whenever you turn an object on).
   Write down the list of numbers (each begins with &quot;0x&quot;) and mail me with
   the problem. Even better, take a screen shot of the complete error display
   and send me that.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> When I choose the 960x600 mode in Setup, the game appears in a box in the
   middle of the screen surrounded by black borders. What's wrong?
<br><b>A.</b> Nothing, that's just how it is. The reason: a monitor can only use certain
   specific resolutions, like 320x200, 640x400, 640x480, 1024x768, and so on.
   So, to get the 960x600 mode, <b>AGS</b> tells the monitor to use its 1024x768 mode,
   and place the game window in the centre.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> Then why doesn't <b>AGS</b> support a 1024x768 mode?
<br><b>A.</b> For compatibility. The lowest resolution supported is 320x200, and all
   other supported resolutions are multiples of this. This gives 640x400 and
   960x600. Without this, <b>AGS</b> would be stuck in 1024x768 and would not allow
   different video modes. Whether you think that would be a good thing or
   not isn't the issue :-)
<li>
<b>Q.</b> I don't get sound from my SB Live! soundcard.
<br><b>A.</b> That's not a question.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> Ok, how do I get sound from my SB Live! soundcard?
<br><b>A.</b> To get any sound at all, you need to have the SB16 emulation enabled. (The
   SB Live install program should have done this for you).
   First of all, run AC Setup and change the MIDI music card to the &quot;General
   MIDI&quot; option. This gives much better sounding MIDI music than the Sound
   Blaster midi driver which is autodetected.
   Secondly, digital sound. This appears to be an incompatibility between
   the SB16 emulator which comes with the SB Live, and AC's sound driver. As
   far as I've tried it, you can get digital sound if you run AC from a Windows
   DOS-prompt, but not if you restart in MS-DOS mode. If you have more luck
   in MS-DOS mode, I'd like to hear about it. You can try setting the digital
   sound driver to &quot;Sound Blaster Pro&quot; in Setup, as this is more compatible
   than the SB16 driver. Also, the IRQ which the SB Live emulation program
   uses can cause problems. Try setting the SB16 emulation to use various IRQ
   lines (5, 7, 9 for example) until you find one which works.
   Want to sort this problem out? Well, mail Creative Labs and tell them to
   release some specs for the SB Live soundcard. The reason there is no proper
   driver and you have to use SB16-emulation is because Creative are keeping
   how the card works secret. That's not my fault.
<li><b>
Q.</b> Where can I get a &quot;DOS mouse driver&quot;?
<br><b>A.</b> If you have Windows installed, it comes with a DOS mouse driver, so just
   try typing MOUSE and press return. If not, try typing C:\WINDOWS\MOUSE and
   press return (change the directory if Windows is installed elsewhere).
   If you don't have one, you can download the Microsoft DOS mouse driver
   from Microsoft's web site.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> I don't get sound under Windows 2000!
<br><b>A.</b> This is due to the way that Windows 2000 works, and cannot be fixed. You
<br>   can run the Windows version of the engine instead, which will give sound,
<br>   however it still has bugs.

<font color=#00a000><b><u>7.3 GAME CREATION PROBLEMS</font></b></u><br><br>
<ul><li>
<b>Q.</b> On my screen, I can't move the main character. Wherever I click to move him,
   he just stands there.
<br><b>A.</b> If the main character isn't on a walkable area, he will not be able to move.
   Load the screen into the Room Editor, and check that the location where the
   man is has a walkable area there.
   If you are upgrading from AC v1, you need to upgrade the room - see
   section 5 for information.
<li><b>
Q.</b> When I enter a certain room, I just get a black screen.
<br><b>A.</b> Make sure that you haven't used a Display Message command in the &quot;Player
   enters screen&quot; event for that room. Remember that this event happens BEFORE
   the screen fades in.
   To make sure, when you get the black screen, try pressing enter, or clicking
   the left mouse button. If nothing happens then something more serious may
   have happened. If this is the case, press Ctrl-Break, which should exit the
   program and give you a list of numbers which you can send to me to
   investigate.
<li><b>
Q.</b> The character isn't drawn behind my walk-behind areas!
<br><b>A.</b> You need to define the base line for the area, or he will always be drawn
   in front. See section 3.1.2 for information.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> My USERGAME.EXE file seems to have disappeared.
<br><b>A.</b> Because this file is your entire game, including the room files, when you
   save a room in the Room Editor it will delete the exe file (because the
   room contained in the exe is out of date). To get it back, simply save the
   game again by going to the Game, Main tab and choosing the &quot;Save game&quot;
   button.
<li>
<b>Q.</b> I get a message &quot;Exiting due to signal SIGxxxx, Shutting down Allegro&quot;
   and it says it &quot;exited without requesting it&quot;.
<br><b>A.</b> If you see a list of numbers, each starting with &quot;0x&quot;, please write them
   down and contact me. Check that you haven't done anything silly, like used
   a sprite or view number which doesn't exist.
</ul><br>
<font color=#00a000><b><u>7.4 KNOWN BUGS</font></b></u><br><br>
<ul><li>A couple of people have reported that attempting to run the game in high-
resolution (640x400) mode causes it to crash on startup. I am investigating
this, so if you have the problem as well, please mail me with a copy of the
error message it prints. You could also try getting the SciTech Display
Doctor from www.scitechsoft.com and install that first, to see if it solves
the problem.
<li>Importing a global function into a room script file causes the room
script not to be executed. I am investigating this.</li>
<li><b>AGS</b> does not run from a UNC-style network path (eg. running the game
from a path like \\MYCOMP\GAMES\AC.EXE ) - you will get a &quot;AC2GAME.DAT not
found&quot; error. The network drive must be mapped to a drive letter for the
game to run. For example, do this:
<br>NET USE V: \\MYCOMP\GAMES
<br>V:\AC.EXE</li>
<li>Inventory Item 0 doesn't work. The workaround - don't use inventory slot
zero, just leave it as &quot;[unused]&quot;.</li>
</ul>
If you think you've found a different bug, tell me about it - see section 8
below for more information.

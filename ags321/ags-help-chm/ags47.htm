<H2>AudioChannel functions and properties</H2>
The AudioChannel instance represents a currently playing audio file. You can use this
instance to check the status of playing sounds, and adjust them.<P>

<I>(Formerly known as SeekMP3PosMillis, which is now obsolete)</I><P>
<PRE>
AudioChannel.Seek(int position)
</PRE>
Seeks the audio clip that is currently playing on this channel to <I>position</I>.<P>
What <I>position</I> represents depends on the FileType of the audio clip:
<UL>

<LI> <B>MIDI</B> - the beat number
<LI> <B>MOD/XM/S3M</B> - the pattern number
<LI> <B>WAV/VOC</B> - the sample number (eg. in a 22050 Hz sound, 22050 = 1 second)
<LI> <B>OGG/MP3</B> - milliseconds offset
</UL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aExplosion.Play();
Wait(40);
channel.Seek(0);
</PRE>
will start playing the <I>aExplosion</I> audio clip, wait for a second, then seek it back to the start.<P>

<A NAME="AudioChannel.SetRoomLocation"></A>
<H3>SetRoomLocation</H3>
<I>(Formerly part of PlayAmbientSound, which is now obsolete)</I><P>
<PRE>
AudioChannel.SetRoomLocation(int x, int y)
</PRE>
Sets the currently playing audio to be a directional sound, eminating from (x,y).<P>
The volume of the channel will be dynamically adjusted depending on how close the player
character is to the co-ordinates. Therefore, as the player walks closer the volume will
increase, and as they walk away the volume will decrease.<P>
The channel's Volume setting sets the maximum possible volume when the player is standing
on the specified co-ordinates.<P>
Pass the co-ordinates as (0,0) to remove the directional effect and return this channel
to playing at its normal volume.<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aMachine.Play();
channel.SetRoomLocation(oMachine.X, oMachine.Y);
</PRE>
will start playing the <I>aMachine</I> audio clip, and set it at the location of the <I>oMachine</I>
room object.<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aExplosion.Play();
Wait(40);
channel.Stop();

<H3>ID property (audio channel)</H3>
<PRE>
readonly int AudioChannel.ID
</PRE>
Gets the Channel ID of this audio channel. You will not normally need to use this,
but it can be used for inter-operating with legacy commands such as StopChannel.<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aExplosion.Play();
Display("Explosion playing on channel %d", channel.ID);
</PRE>
will start playing the <I>aExplosion</I> audio clip, and display which channel it is playing on.<P>

<PRE>
readonly int AudioChannel.LengthMs
</PRE>
Gets the length of the audio playing on this channel, in milliseconds.<P>
This is supported by all file types, but with MIDI music it is only accurate to the nearest second.<P>
If this channel is not currently playing any audio, returns 0.<P>

<A NAME="AudioChannel.Panning"></A>
<H3>Panning property</H3>
<PRE>
int AudioChannel.Panning
</PRE>
Gets/sets the panning of this audio channel.<P>
Panning allows you to adjust the stereo balance of the audio. The default is 0, which is
centred and will play at the same volume on both speakers. However you can adjust this 
between -100 (fully left) to 100 (fully right) to adjust the balance between the speakers.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> MIDI music files do not support panning.<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aExplosion.Play();
channel.Panning = -100;
</PRE>
will start playing the <I>aExplosion</I> audio clip on the left speaker only.<P>

<I>(Formerly known as GetCurrentMusic, which is now obsolete)</I><P>
<PRE>
readonly AudioClip* AudioChannel.PlayingClip
</PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = System.AudioChannels[2];
if (channel.PlayingClip == null)
{
  Display("Nothing is playing on channel 2");

<PRE>
readonly int AudioChannel.Position
</PRE>

<H3>PositionMs property</H3>
<PRE>
readonly int AudioChannel.PositionMs

This is supported by all file types except MIDI, and returns the current offset into the sound
in milliseconds. MIDI files will always return 0.<P>

<H3>Volume property (audio channel)</H3>
<I>(Formerly known as SetChannelVolume, which is now obsolete)</I> <br> 
<I>(Formerly known as SetMusicVolume, which is now obsolete)</I><P>
<PRE>
int AudioChannel.Volume
</PRE>
Gets/sets the volume of this audio channel, from 0 to 100. This allows you to dynamically
adjust the volume of a playing sound.<P>
This command adjusts the volume of this channel relative to the other channels.
It is still constrained within the overall volume, set by the System.Volume property.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> This command only affects the current sound being played on the channel.
When a new audio clip starts playing on this channel, the volume will be set to the
DefaultVolume of the new audio clip.<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The volume returned by this property is the channel's base volume, ie. it does
not include the effects of any directional audio set with SetRoomLocation, or any temporary
volume drop while speech is playing.<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Example:</FONT>
<PRE>
AudioChannel *channel = aExplosion.Play();
Wait(40);
channel.Volume = 20;
</PRE>
will start playing the <I>aExplosion</I> audio clip, wait for a second, then reduce its volume.<P>

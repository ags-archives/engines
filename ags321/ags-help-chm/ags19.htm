<H2>Global variables</H2>
The Global Variables pane allows you to easily add variables to your game which
can then be accessed from all your scripts.<P>
In previous versions of AGS, declaring a global variable in the script involved
defining it in three different places, with import and export clauses in the
appropriate locations. Now, this whole process is vastly simplified with the new
Global Variables Editor.<P>
<B>When should I use a global variable?</B><P>
Use a global variable when you need to store some information that you need
to access from different scripts. For example, if you want to store the player's
health and you want all your different scripts to be able to access this value,
then use a global variable.<P>
If you just need to store some information locally (for example, a "door opened" flag
that only applies to one particular room) then you should declare the variable
manually at the top of the room's script file instead.<P>
<B>What about GlobalInts and Graphical Variables?</B><P>
GlobalInts and Graphical Variables were ways in which previous versions of AGS
provided global variable capabilities. They are now considered obsolete, and are
replaced with this new Global Variables system instead.<P>
<B>How do I use global variables?</B><P>
The Global Variables Editor is pretty self-explanitory. To add a variable, right-click
and choose "Add". You can name the variable, and choose its type and initial value.
Most of the time you'll probably be using the <I>int</I> and <I>String</I> types. Optionally,
you can also set a default value for the variable.<P>
Then, in your scripts it's a simple matter of just using the variable with the name
that you gave it. Simple! So, for example if you add an int global variable called
"myVariable", then in your script you can just do things like this:<P>
<PRE>
if (myVariable == 3)
{
  myVariable = 4;
}
</PRE>
or<P>
<TT>Display("myVariable: %d", myVariable);</TT><P>
That's it! Just use it as you'd use any other variable declared in the script.<P>
Note that some of the types available are managed instance pointers, like "GUI",
"DynamicSprite" and "Character". These are for more advanced users only.
If you create one of these you cannot set a default value, and it will initially
be set to <I>null</I>. You will need to initialize the pointer in your script to
point to something before you use it.<P>

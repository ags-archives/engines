<H2>Translations</H2>
AGS now makes it easy for you to create translations of your games.
Select "Make translation source" from the Game menu of the editor. A dialog box
appears, which allows you to type the name of the file to create. Press OK, and the
editor will export all your game's text to the named file.<P>
However, unlike the Text Dumper, the translation maker simply writes all lines
of game text to the file - no script sources, just all the displayable text from
the game. The file is generated with each line of text seperated by a blank line.<P>
You can now give this file to your translaters. They should <B>fill in each blank line
with the corresponding translation of the English line above it (DO NOT REPLACE THE
ORIGINAL ENGLISH LINES WITH THE TRANSLATION)</B>. If a line is left blank, it will simply
not be translated.<P>
Once the translation is done, choose the "Create compiled translation" option from
the Game menu. Select the translated text file, and it will be converted into a
compiled translation (<TT>.TRA</TT>) file, which can be used with the game engine.<P>
To use the translation, simply place the .TRA file in same folder as the game's EXE
file. Run the game Setup program, and select the translation from the drop-down box.
Then, run the game, and all the text should be translated.<P>
<I>NOTE: With SCI fonts, only 128 characters are available, so many of the extended
characters needed for non-english translations are not available. You may need to use
substitute characters, or consider using TTF fonts for international applications. However,
bear in mind that TTF rendering slows down the engine.</I><P>
While most in-game text is translated automatically, there are a few instances when
this is not possible. These are when a text script uses functions like StrCat to build
up a string, or StrComp to check some user input. In these cases, you can use the
<A HREF="ags40.htm#GetTranslation">GetTranslation</A> function to make it work.<P>

<H2>Lip sync</H2>
If you want, AGS can pretend to 'read' out speech text. Go to the 'Lip Sync' pane
in the editor.<P>
Normally when a character is talking, AGS simply cycles through the speech animation
from start to finish, and then loops back round. However, lip syncing allows you to be
cleverer by specifying a particular frame to go with various letters and sounds. Then,
as the character talks, AGS plays appropriate frames to simulate the character actually
saying those words.<P>
In the Lip Sync Editor, you have 20 text boxes, one for each possible frame of the
talking loop. In each box, you can enter all the letters which will cause that frame of
the loop to be played. Letter combinations such as 'th' and 'ch' can be used too - AGS
will match each part of the spoken text to the longest possible phrase in the lip sync
editor.<P>
Seperate the letters by forward slashes. For example,<P>
<PRE>
3  R/S/Th/G
</PRE>
will mean that frame 3 of the character's talking animation is shown whenever the
letter R, S, Th or G is spoken.<P>
The "Default frame for unlisted characters" box allows you to set which frame is used
when a character not listed in any of the text boxes is encountered.<P>

<B>Voice speech lip sync</B><P>
AGS supports lip syncing voice speech to the talking animation. If you enable this
feature, you cannot use the standard lip-sync for non-voice lines.<P>
<B>NOTE: This is an unofficial feature and is not currently supported. Use at
your own risk</B><P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The voice sync feature only supports Sierra-style speech.<P>
In order to do this, you need to download the third-party PAMELA application:<P>
<TT>http://www.gippsland.monash.edu.au/~myles/catnap/pamela/</TT><P>
Set up the phenomes so that there are only 10 (or as many talking frames as you have)
available choices. Enter these into the "Lip Sync" pane in AGS to create the association
between the pamela phenome code and the AGS frame number. <br> 
For example, enter "AY0" into frame 0's box, "E" into frame 1, and so forth - corresponding
to how it is set up in Pamela. Save the game, then uncheck the "Lip sync enabled" box to ensure
that it doesn't attempt to use "AY0" to lip-sync normal text paragraphs.<P>
Use the Pamela application on each of your speech lines, and save a Pamela project file
(.pam file) for each speech file, naming it the same as the speech.<P>
For example, the pamela project for  EGO46.MP3  would be called  EGO46.PAM, placed
in your game folder.<P>
When you Rebuild VOX Files, this pam file is compiled into the speech.vox and will be used
to sync the animation of the talking frames during the game.<P>

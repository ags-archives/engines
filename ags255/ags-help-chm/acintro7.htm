      Getting Started with AGS - Part 7</b></h2>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>Animations</h3>
      <p>A graphical adventure game would be no good without animations. These
      range from commonly-used animations such as the main character walking, to
      a flag waving in the background in one particular screen.</p>
      <p>Animations in AGS are managed using <i>Views</i>. A view is a set of
      one or more <i>loops</i>. A loop is a set of frames which, when played in
      sequence, give the illusion of movement. Go to the &quot;Views&quot; mode
      in the main tree. This is the View Editor where you will put together all
      your animations.</p>
      <p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="images/intro7_2.jpg" width="535" height="397"><br>
      The View Editor showing view 1</i></p>
      <p>You should see View 1 selected in the list, and on the right you'll see
      lots of frames of Roger's walking animation. As I'm sure you've guessed,
      the &quot;New view&quot; button will create a new blank view.</p>
      <p>Each loop is displayed as a row of images (one for each frame), going
      from left to right. To change the image for a frame, double-click the
      image, and you'll be presented with the sprite manager where you can
      select the image to use. <b>All images for use with views are imported as
      usual via the sprite manager </b>before they can be inserted into a frame.<br>
      At the right hand end of a loop, you'll see the text &quot;New
      frame&quot;, which you can click to create a new extra frame at the end of
      the loop. You can also right-click a frame to insert a new one before or
      after it.</p>
      <p>You'll notice each frame has three pieces of text underneath the image:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>SPD: 0</b>&nbsp; is the frame's <b>relative</b> speed, which you
          can change by clicking on the &quot;SPD:&quot; text. This number adds
          a delay to the amount of time which the frame is displayed for,
          therefore a larger number makes it stay longer. You can use negative
          numbers to specifically shorten the frame's display time.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>NO SND</b>&nbsp; allows you to assign a sound number that will
          get played when this frame comes around in the animation. This feature
          is designed for footstep sounds, but has many other uses as well.
          Using sound will be covered later in the tutorial.</li>
        <li><b>NORMAL&nbsp; </b>toggles whether the frame is displayed normally
          or mirrored left-right. This feature allows you to just create
          animations for your character walking right, and then use the same
          images for the walking left loop, but simply toggle this flag to
          &quot;<i>FLIPPED</i>&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How you use these views to actually run an animation in game will be
      explained later on.</p>
      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>If you remember back to part 3 of this tutorial, we talked about three
      types of thing that the player can interact with - hotspots, objects and
      characters. We've now covered the former two, so now it's time to take a
      look at characters.</p>
      <p>Put simply, a character is similar to an object, except that it can
      move between different rooms in the game, take part in conversations,
      carry its own inventory, be scaled up and down, lit according to light
      levels in the room, and more.</p>
      <p>Go to the &quot;Characters&quot; mode in the main tree. You'll see that
      so far you only have one character in the list, labelled &quot;0:
      ROGER&quot;. You can create a new character by clicking the &quot;New
      Character&quot; button under the list.</p>
      <p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="images/intro7_1.jpg" width="535" height="397"><br>
      The Character Editor</i></p>
      <p>There are quite a few options available for each character. Rather than
      explain them all here, we'll just cover the most important ones - you can
      find a full description of all the options in the manual.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Start in room</b> - this sets which room number the character
          starts off in at the beginning of the game.</li>
        <li><b>This is the player character</b> - sets the currently selected
          character as the initial player character when the game starts up. The
          game will start off in whatever room number the <i>Starts in room</i>
          option is set to for the player character.<br>
          This option is greyed out for the currently selected player character.
          To change it, simply select the box on another character.</li>
        <li><b>Normal view </b>- sets which view is used for the normal walking
          animation of the character. The view specified here must have 4 or 8
          loops, and the first frame of each loop is the standing still frame.<br>
          For a 4-loop character, when walking diagonally the closest straight
          direction is chosen for display. With an 8-loop character, all 8
          directions are displayed depending on the character's direction.<br>
          Which loop represents which direction is shown in the Views mode (eg.
          &quot;Loop 0 (down)&quot;).&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>No interaction</b> - if checked, then this character will be
          see-through to mouse clicks. This is similar to the way the player
          character worked in Lucasarts games - you cannot actually click on
          Guybrush, it will always activate whatever is behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>The &quot;Import character&quot; button</b> allows you to import
          a pre-made AGS character into your game. This is <b>NOT</b> how you
          normally create a character from scratch - rather, this option is what
          you use if someone else has specifically created a CHA file for you.<br>
          Note that importing a character will create a new slot for the import,
          so you cannot use it to overwrite an existing character.</li>
        <li><b>The &quot;Export character&quot; button</b> exports the current
          character to a CHA file, in order that it can be imported into another
          game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The character's &quot;<i>Name</i>&quot; field simply gives you an easy
      way to identify the character in the editor, and can also be accessed from
      the game script if desired.</p>
      <p>The &quot;<i>Script name</i>&quot; field is very important, as it sets
      the name by which the character will be referred to in dialog scripting
      and text scripting. The reason for having this seperate name is that the
      script name can only contain the letters A-Z, whereas the main <i>Name </i>field
      can contain any characters.</p>
      <h3>Game starting point</h3>
      <p>Just in case you missed it, I'll repeat what was just said in the
      Characters section - the &quot;<i>Starts in room</i>&quot; setting of the
      player character is used to determine which room the game starts off in.</p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td><b>TIP:</b> This feature can be handy for testing various parts of
            your game. For example, when you're working on room 16, set the
            starting room to room 16 so that you can get to it instantly when
            you run the game to test it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Cutscenes</h3>
      <p>You can easily add intro, outro and cutscene sequences to your game.
      There is no specific feature to do this - you simply use the provided
      animation and movement commands to do whatever you like.</p>
      <table border="0">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>A <i>cutscene</i> is simply the name given to a sequence of
            actions over which the player has no control. This usually applies
            to the entire introduction sequence, as well as far simpler in-game
            events. For example, if the player goes to pick up a rock from the
            ground, you may wish to use a bending-down animation to show him
            picking it up. During this bending down and standing back up, the
            player cannot control proceedings, so it is a cutscene.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>There are two main ways of creating cutscenes - the Interaction Editor,
      and the text script.</p>
      <p>To start with, you'll probably be more comfortable using the
      Interaction Editor, as it provides a point-and-click way of setting up the
      commands. As you progress with AGS, or if you have some programming
      experience, you may prefer to jump straight to the text script.</p>
      <p>Right, firstly let's do something very simple. When the player goes to
      pick up the key from the floor of our room, we want him to walk over to it
      first rather than it just disappearing from wherever he's standing.</p>
      <p>So, we want to add something extra to picking up the key. How do we do
      this? Yes, that's right, we need the Interaction Editor for Object 0 in
      Room 1 (which is the key). If it's not already loaded, fire it up and
      return to the interactions we created earlier:</p>
      <p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="images/intro4_3.jpg" width="480" height="360"><br>
      Remember this?</i></p>
      <p>Now, we want the player to walk across to the key <b>before</b> it
      disappears, so right-click on &quot;Object - Remove an object&quot; and
      select &quot;Add action before this&quot;. We're greeted by the Action
      Editor once again.</p>
      <p>Select &quot;Character - Move Character&quot; from the drop-down list.
      Change the Character setting to &quot;Roger&quot; (it will then be
      displayed as &quot;EGO&quot;, the script name).</p>
      <p><b>Eeek!</b> It wants a destination X and Y location! We don't know
      that yet, so press OK to close the action editor, and then Close the
      interaction editor too.</p>
      <p>Move the mouse cursor to where the key is on the background. Look just
      above the background image, and you should see &quot;Mouse pos: 205,
      128&quot; or something similar. These are the X and Y co-ordinates,
      respectively, of the key's location. So, note them down, and return to
      the Interaction Editor.</p>
      <p>Double-click the &quot;Character - Move Character&quot; entry to open
      it up for editing, and click Change on the Destination X and Y locations
      to set them to the numbers we just discovered. We also want to set the
      &quot;Wait for move to finish&quot; option to True - otherwise, the
      command will just start Roger off on his way, and then immediately proceed
      to pick the key up before he gets there!</p>
      <p>OK out of the action editor and you should see something similar to
      this:</p>
      <p align="center"><i><img border="0" src="images/intro7_3.jpg" width="509" height="230">&nbsp;<br>
      </i><i>Our new command is top of the list for execution</i></p>
      <p>Save the room and game, and try it out!<p>OK, I think we've had enough
      of animations and cutscenes for now. We'll return later to explore actual
      animations and more complex cutscenes. If you want to try some out, check
      out the &quot;Character - Quick animation&quot; command to get you
      going.&nbsp;

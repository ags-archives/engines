<H3>Hotspot interactions</H3>
<DL>


</TD>

<DD> occurs repeatedly while the player character
is standing on the hotspot.

</TD>

the "Look" mode (cursor mode 1).

</TD>
<DT> Interact with hotspot
<DD> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot while
in the "Interact" mode (cursor mode 2).

</TD>
<DT> Use inventory on hotspot
<DD> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot
while in the "Use inventory" mode (cursor mode 4). You can use the "If inventory
item was used" conditional to distinguish which item they used.
 
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> When the "If inventory was used" conditional is met, the
player will lose the inventory item, UNLESS "do not lose inventory items" is
checked in the General Settings pane.<P>

</TD>
<DT> Speak to hotspot
<DD> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot while in
the "Talk" mode (cursor mode 3).

</TD>
<DT> Any click on hotspot
<DD> occurs when the player clicks on the hotspot in
any cursor mode (except Walk). This allows you to add extra modes like
smell, taste, push, pull, and so on. This event also occurs as well as
the other event for the Look, Interact and Talk modes.

</TD>
<DT> Mouse moves over hotspot
<DD> occurs repeatedly while the mouse cursor is
over the hotspot. You can use this to highlight the cursor, and for other
various effects.

<H3>Room interactions</H3>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Walk off left
<DD> occurs when the player character walks off the left edge
of the screen.

</TD>
<DT> Walk off right
<DD> occurs when the player walks off the right edge of the

edge of the screen.

<DT> Walk off top
<DD> occurs when the player character walks off the top edge
of the screen.

</TD>
<DT> First time enters screen
<DD> occurs the first time the player enters the
room. This event occurs AFTER the screen has faded in, so it allows you to
display a message describing the scene.

</TD>
<DT> Player enters screen (before fadein)
<DD> occurs just after the room is loaded into memory.
This event occurs every time the player enters the screen, and it happens
BEFORE the screen has faded in, which allows you to change object graphics
and do other things to the screen which the player won't notice.<P>
<I>NOTE: This event is ONLY meant for adjusting things such as object and
character placement. Do NOT use this event for any sort of automated intro
to the room - use the "Enters Screen After Fade In" event for that instead.</I>

</TD>
<DT> Repeatedly execute
<DD> occurs repeatedly on every interpreter cycle. The
normal game speed is 40 cycles per second, so this event occurs about
every 25 milliseconds.

</TD>
<DT> Player enters screen (after fadein)
<DD> occurs every time the player enters the
room, AFTER the screen has faded-in. Suitable for displaying text
descriptions and so on, that you want the player to see.

</TD>
<DT> Player leaves screen
<DD> occurs when the player leaves the screen, just
before the screen fades out.

<H3>Inventory item interactions</H3>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Look at inventory
<DD> occurs when the player clicks on the inventory item
while in the "look" mode.

</TD>
<DT> Interact with inventory
<DD> currently, because the Interact mode selects the
inventory item, this interaction can only be triggered by manually calling
the RunInventoryInteraction text script function.

</TD>
<DT> Speak to inventory
<DD> only applies to the Lucasarts-style inventory,
occurs when the player clicks the Talk icon on the inventory item.

</TD>
<DT> Use inventory on inv
<DD> occurs when the player uses another inventory
object on this one. Add a "Conditional - if inventory item was used" check
to determine which item they used.
This event allows the player to combine items, and
so on. For example, if they had picked up a laptop computer and a battery,
seperately, then you could use this to allow them to insert the battery into
the computer.

</TD>
<DT> Other click on inventory
<DD> only applies to the Lucasarts-style inventory,
occurs when the player clicks any other cursor mode (apart from look, talk
and use_inv) on the item.

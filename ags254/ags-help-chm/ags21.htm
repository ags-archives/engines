<H2>Lip sync</H2>
If you want, AGS can pretend to 'read' out speech text. Go to the 'Lip Sync' pane
in the editor.<P>
Normally when a character is talking, AGS simply cycles through the speech animation
from start to finish, and then loops back round. However, lip syncing allows you to be
cleverer by specifying a particular frame to go with various letters and sounds. Then,
as the character talks, AGS plays appropriate frames to simulate the character actually
saying those words.<P>
In the Lip Sync Editor, you have 20 text boxes, one for each possible frame of the
talking loop. In each box, you can enter all the letters which will cause that frame of
the loop to be played. Letter combinations such as 'th' and 'ch' can be used too - AGS
will match each part of the spoken text to the longest possible phrase in the lip sync
editor.<P>
Seperate the letters by forward slashes. For example,<P>
<PRE>
3  R/S/Th/G
</PRE>
will mean that frame 3 of the character's talking animation is shown whenever the
letter R, S, Th or G is spoken.<P>
The "Default frame for unlisted characters" box allows you to set which frame is used
when a character not listed in any of the text boxes is encountered.<P>

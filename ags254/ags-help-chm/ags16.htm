<H2>Backing up your game</H2>
You will no doubt want to back up your game files, and should do so regularly during
your game development. But which files should you back up?<P>
When taking a backup, make sure you copy <B>ALL</B> the files listed below:<P>
<UL>

<LI> <B>AC2GAME.DTA</B> - this is the main data file for your game and contains almost
all of the game settings. Without it, you cannot edit your game.
<LI> <B>ACSPRSET.SPR</B> - this is your game's sprite file, containing all the sprites
from the sprite manager.
<LI> <B>EDITOR.DAT</B> - this contains various information that is only needed by the
editor, and not included in your compiled game. This includes your global script source
code, and your room names, so without this file your game is useless.
<LI> <B>ROOM*.CRM</B> - all the ROOM*.CRM files are your room files, and obviously without
one of them you wouldn't be able to go into that room any longer.
<LI> <B>INTRO.CRM</B> - the Room 0 file, assuming you have one.
<LI> <B>AGSFNT*.TTF, AGSFNT*.WFN</B> - these files contain any fonts you have imported.
</UL>
<P>
Also remember to back up any sound, music and video files you are using.<P>
Note that you do <B>not</B> need to back up the AC2GAME.AGS file, this is a compiled version
of your game which can be reconstructed from the above files.<P>

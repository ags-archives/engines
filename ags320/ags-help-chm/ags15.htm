<H2>Distributing your game</H2>
When you choose the "Build EXE" option in the Editor, a "Compiled" sub-directory
is created in your game's folder, with all the files that you need to distribute
your game. At its simplest this will just be your game executable and the setup
program, but you may also have audio and speech libraries (AUDIO.VOX and
SPEECH.VOX); and if you have selected to split resources files, you will also
have several files named "game.001", "game.002", and so forth.<P>
So, when you want to upload your game to the internet, just zip up the files in
the Compiled folder, and there you go!<P>
<I>NOTE: It is not possible to load the exe file back into the AGS Editor. This
means two things when only the EXE file is available: (1) other people can't
edit your game's data, and (2) you can't either. Always keep a backup of the
other files produced (*.CRM, GAME.AGF, etc) as they are what the Editor
needs to be able to load your game for editing.</I><P>
<I>TIP:</I> You can make a "Loading..." style splash screen to be displayed while your game starts
up. To do so, simply save the image as  PRELOAD.PCX (must be the same resolution and colour depth
as the game) in the game folder, and build the game. It should then display while the game is loading.<P>
<I>NOTE: Due to the licenses of code used by AGS, your documentation should acknowledge the
following:</I><P>
TrueType font display uses ALFont by Javier Gonzalez and the Freetype project. Distributed
under the terms of the FreeType project license.<P>
OGG player is alogg by Javier Gonzalez, using the Ogg Vorbis decoder, which is available

MP3 player is almp3, by Javier Gonzalez and the FreeAmp team. It uses the mpg123 MP3 decoder,
and is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.<P>
You should also include all the license_* files from the DOCS directory with your game.<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> If you intend to make money for your game, be it shareware or commercial,
it is imperative that you read the Legal Information page on the AGS website, currently
at http://www.bigbluecup.com/aclegal.htm<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The AUDIO.VOX file contains audio clips that you have marked as "InSeperateVOX"
in the editor. This allows you to have an optional audio download, if your game uses lots
of sound files but you don't want the player to have to download them.<P>

<H3>Custom icon</H3>
If you wish, you can use your own custom icon when you build a Windows EXE
file. To do this, simply place your icon in your game's folder, and name
it USER.ICO. Then, load the editor and save the game.<P>
AGS is only able to build your custom icon if you are running the editor on
Windows 2000, XP or Vista. If you're using Windows 98 then your game will be
built with the standard AGS icon.<P>
<I>NOTE: The icon <B>must</B> be a proper Windows .ICO file, <B>not</B> just a renamed
BMP file. Icon editors, such as AX-Icons from http://www.axialis.com, will convert
it for you.</I><P>
You can also have a custom icon for the Setup program generated. To do so, create
your icon as above but name it <B>setup.ico</B> in the game folder.<P>

<H3>Splitting resource files</H3>
Some people found that once their game became large, the single EXE file
was slow to load due to anti-virus checkers scanning the whole file.
AGS includes an option to split up the resource files into smaller chunks
to avoid this happening. On the General Settings pane you'll notice a
setting "Split resource files into X Mb sized chunks".<P>
If you tick this, then type in a number such as 1 or 2, then save the game,
the game data will be split up into chunks that size, named GAME.001,
GAME.002 and so on.<P>
Some resources are still combined into the EXE file but
all the rooms will be placed into the other files.
If you use this option, you need to distribute your game's EXE file plus
all the GAME.00? files.<P>

<H2>The demo game</H2>
The first thing you'll probably want to do is to run the demo game. This
game will try to show you some of what AGS can do.<P>
To run the demo, choose the "Open the Demo Game" option from the AGS folder
in your start menu. If you're looking for the files, they're located in the
All Users Application Data folder (this is for compatibility with Windows Vista's
new security filters).<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The demo game is currently under development. It has various unfinished
or unimplemented areas.<P>

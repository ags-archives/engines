      <h2 align="center"><b>Getting Started with AGS</b></h2>
      <p>So, you've downloaded AGS. You want to make an adventure game. But
      where do you start?
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, I should say at this point - download the demo game, and use
      it as a reference if you get stuck. Play it through before you read this
      tutorial, so you get a feel for how AGS works. The demo game comes in
      source form, so you can check out how it was all done.
      </p>
      <p>(<b><i>NOTE</i></b>: before we start, this tutorial was made using
      v2.5b of AGS. If you have a newer version, there may be minor
      inconsistencies in the screenshots where extra options have been added and
      so forth, but don't worry about it).
      </p>
      <h3>Creating the game
      </h3>
      <p align="left">Now, you feel you're ready to go ahead and make a game of
      your own. So, start up the AGS Editor by double-clicking the <i>AGSEDIT.EXE</i>
      file, and you should be greeted by the following screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1.jpg" width="300" height="340"><br>
            <i>The &quot;Welcome to AGS&quot; dialog</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Make sure that &quot;Start a new game&quot; is selected, and click OK. You
      will be presented with the Create New Game dialog box:
      </p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1a.jpg" width="294" height="248"><br>
      <i>Create New Game dialog</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Firstly,
      you need to choose which template you are going to use for your new game. AGS comes with 
		two, and you can download
      others from the internet.<br>
		The &quot;Default Game&quot; template is what we'll be using, and it comes with 
		some default graphics to get you started quickly. The &quot;Empty Game&quot; 
		template is something you may want to use later on when you're familiar 
		with AGS - it comes with no default graphics at all.</p>
      <p align="left">Then, you need to choose a folder name for your game. This
      is only used for the name
      of the folder that your game is created in, and the name of the final EXE
      file you compile. It is limited to 15 characters or less.<br>
      <i>(NOTE: If you are going to want to make a DOS compile, you should
      ensure it is 8 characters or less)</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Click the <i>Next</i> button, and after a short wait you
      will be prompted to select a resolution for your game. For the purposes of
      this tutorial, we will use 320x200. Don't worry, you can change it later
      (via the &quot;Set Game Resolution&quot; option on the Game menu).
      </p>
      <p>Now, you should be faced with the main AGS Editor window:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro2.jpg" width="400" height="241"><br>
            <i>The main editor window</i></p>
      <p>All these options and modes can look a bit intimidating at first, but
      don't worry - it's not as complex as it seems!</p>
      <h3>Starting off&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>The first thing to do is to change that horrible &quot;New game&quot;
      in the title bar into something more catchy. For the purposes of this
      tutorial, I'm going to call it the incredibly lame &quot;Roger's Adventure&quot;, but you can
      use whatever you like.</p>
      <p>The name you type here is displayed in the taskbar while your game is
      running, and will also be the window caption if the player runs the game
      in Windowed mode.</p>
      <p>Now, let's briefly examine the various options we have in front of us.
      Let's check these options to begin with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Debug Mode</b> - Since we are going to be developing the game, we
          want the assistance of the debug features in the engine. This allows
          you to do things like teleport to different rooms, give yourself all
          the inventory items, and so forth. You would un-check this before
          compiling the final version of the game when it's complete.</li>
        <li><b>Anti-glide mode</b> - without it, the character movement can look
          somewhat silly.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Pixel-perfect click detection</b> - improves the game playability
          by making sure that clicking transparent regions of objects won't
          trigger them.</li>
        <li><b>Don't automatically lose inventory</b> - makes things less
          confusing later on because inventory items won't automatically
          disappear when the player does things.</li>
        <li><b>Characters turn before walking</b> - if the character is facing
          right, and you click to move him left, he'll rotate round before
          starting to move. This is what the Sierra and Lucasarts
          point-and-click games did, and looks a bit more professional.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personally, I always check these 5 options when starting a new game. As
      you get a feel for AGS, you can decide what suits you best, and change
      these options again later. My main window now looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center">

      <i>The main window after I make my adjustments</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Colour choices</h3>
      <p>Now, at this stage we really need to decide whether we want to create a
      palette-based (8-bit, 256-colour) game, or a hi-color (16-bit) game.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The advantage of a palette is that the game size will be smaller,
          and thus easier to distribute on the Internet. The game will also run
          up to twice as fast as using hi-colour. Neat fading and colour cycling
          effects are also possible.</li>
        <li>The advantage of hi-colour is that you don't have to mess around
          with palette slots, you just import your graphics and they just work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'll cover both methods briefly below.</p>
      <p><i>(NOTE: We need to decide now because when you import graphics, they
      will be set to the game's colour depth. Should you change your mind later,
      you would have to re-import all the graphics).</i></p>
      <h3>Creating a 256-colour game&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Palette&quot; entry in the tree on the left. You
      should see this:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro4.jpg" width="450" height="271"><br>
      <i>The Palette Editor</i></p>
      <p>The palette display has a grid with the 256 colour slots on it. The
      first 17 are marked &quot;L&quot;, which is short for Locked. These slots
      are fixed and you cannot change the colours of them. They are needed for
      various in-game displays such as the Save/Load dialogs, and so on.</p>
      <p>There are then about 25 colours displayed with no &quot;L&quot;. These
      are <b>game-wide</b> colours. That means that those palette slots have
      those colours throughout the game, in every single room.</p>
      <p>Finally, the remaining colours, marked &quot;X&quot;, are <b>background</b>
      colours and vary from room to room. This allows for different types of
      background to use different ranges of colours.</p>
      <p>The default palette setup is a little badly weighted. Your GUI and main
      character graphics will have to use just the game-wide colours, since they
      are shown in more than one room. Therefore, unless you want a greyscale
      main character, the colours displayed are probably not enough.</p>
      <p>So, let's swap some background colours for some game-wide ones. Select
      the first &quot;X&quot; slot, then hold shift and click on the last slot
      in the row marked &quot;80&quot;. The screen should look as follows:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro5.jpg" width="425" height="256"><br>
      <i>We have selected colours 42-95</i></p>
      <p>Now, un-check the &quot;This colour is room-dependant&quot; box. All
      the selected &quot;X&quot;s turn into various colours.</p>
      <p>If you select one of these colours, you'll see some R, G and B sliders
      appear on the right, where you can manually adjust the colour of that
      slot. You can either do this for every single colour, or you can set up
      slots 42-95 in another paint package, save a PCX file, and use the
      &quot;Import slots from file&quot; button.</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6.jpg" width="425" height="256"><br>
      <i>I've imported various colours</i></p>
      <p>As you can see from the screenshot above, I've chosen to import various
      skin-type colours as well as various other ranges. What colours you use is
      up to you, and depends on what sort of colour scheme you're going for with
      your graphics.</p>
      <p><i>(NOTE: You should set up the palette as well as you can now, because
      changing it later may require you to re-import some graphics).</i></p>
      <h3>Creating a 16-bit colour game</h3>
      <p>Again, go to the Palette mode. Click the button in the bottom-right
      labelled &quot;Convert game to hi-colour&quot;. A warning message will
      prompt you to make sure. Confirm it, and you're done.</p>

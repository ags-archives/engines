AGS is an adventure game creation system. As such, it is provided to you in
good faith by the author. Chris Jones cannot be held responsible for the
contents of any works created with AGS, including but not limited to any which
infringe on copyright, are libellous or contain offensive material.
Please use AGS responsibly.<P>
AGS allows user-made "Plugins" to be incorporated into games created by the system.
These Plugins can access all standard Windows functionality and are therefore
not protected from system functions as the scripting language is.
Chris Jones cannot be held responsible for any Plugins for AGS which you use
in your game. Any problems with the Plugin should be addressed to its author.<P>
Anything you distribute which has been created with AGS <B>MUST</B> retain the Version resources
unaltered in order to display the AGS version and copyright in the Version tab of the EXE
properties. <br> 
You may use a resource hacker to replace the icon with a hi-color version, so long as
the Version is left intact.<P>
Please note that this is the <B>only</B> evidence that remains that your game was created
with AGS - I do not place any splash screens or copyright messages in your game, and
leaving the version tab is all I ask.<P>

      <h2 align="center"><b>Getting Started with AGS - Part 8</b></h2>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>Conversations</h3>
      <p>What fun would an adventure be if there were no other characters to
      talk to? Not a lot, it has to be said.</p>
      <p>How much you go into dialog depends of course on your game style.
      Generally, Sierra games used to just have one fixed line of dialog which
      the characters would talk about, possibly changing if you talked to the
      same person again.<br>
      Lucasarts games (and some Sierra titles such as QFG) on the other hand,
      had complete dialog trees through which you could choose your topics to
      talk about.</p>
      <p>AGS lets you do it whichever way you want. We'll start off by looking
      at the complete dialog tree approach, and then see how easy it is to cut
      it down to get a Sierra-style system.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now, before we go any further, let's consider for a moment what
      conversation structure we want. It's going to be a lot easier to implement
      if we have this planned in advance. For this tutorial, we'll go for a
      structure like this:&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="1" src="images/intro8_1.jpg" width="537" height="259"><br>
      <i>Our planned dialog tree</i>
      <p>In other words, when we first speak to the other character, we will say
      &quot;Greetings!&quot;. After he replies, we will then be presented with
      three options to choose from.<br>
      The &quot;Tell me more about your wares&quot; option will then lead us to
      be able to ask a different set of questions.</p>
      <p>Before we begin, we need to create a second character - we can't just
      have Roger talking to himself! Go to the &quot;Characters&quot; pane, and
      click the &quot;New Character&quot; button tucked away underneath the list
      box. Give the new character a name, I'll call him <i>Merchant</i>.<br>
      Now - and this bit is vital - you also need to set this new character's <b>script
      name</b>. This is the name by which we refer to him when creating our
      dialogs. I'll just use &quot;MERCHANT&quot; as the script name.</p>
      <p>Ok, all done? Go to the &quot;Dialogs&quot; pane in the editor, and we
      are presented with a rather empty looking screen:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro8_2.jpg" width="419" height="275"><br>
      <i>The &quot;Dialogs&quot; pane</i></p>
      <p>Conversations in AGS are made up of <b>topics</b>. A topic consists of
      a set of options that the player can talk about - not all of which are
      necessarily available to the player at the start of the game. When the
      player selects an option from a topic, the topic's <b>dialog script</b> is
      run.&nbsp;<p>Each topic can contain some startup text, which is displayed
      before the options are presented to the player. Our &quot;Greetings&quot;
      line qualifies for this, so we don't need to make a special topic for it.<p>Right,
      let's make our first topic. Click the &quot;New option&quot; button three
      times, and three new rows will appear in the window. Type an option into
      each:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro8_3.jpg" width="475" height="301"><br>
      We've inserted three options for topic 0</i><p>While we're at it, let's
      create the next set of options too. Click the &quot;New topic&quot; button
      (you may have to scroll down to see it - it's hidden under the topic list
      box), and a new blank Topic 1 is created. Again, create three new options
      and type them in.<p>Now, go back to the first topic (select &quot;Topic
      0&quot; in the list box), and then click the &quot;Edit script&quot;
      button. You'll be presented with a new window that looks similar to this:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro8_4.jpg" width="474" height="203"><br>
      The dialog script editor</i><p>Each of the &quot;@&quot; lines is an <b>entry
      point</b>. These define the different places where your script can start.&nbsp;
      The &quot;@S&quot; entry point happens when the topic is first entered -
      and so this is where we want our &quot;Greetings&quot; text to be
      displayed.<p>Dialog scripting is very simple. It takes the form:<p><font face="Courier New">CHARID:
      &quot;Text to say&quot;</font><p>So, in between the &quot;@S&quot; and the
      &quot;@1&quot; lines, insert a couple of new lines, and type the
      following:<p><font face="Courier New">EGO: &quot;Greetings!&quot;<br>
      MERCHANT: &quot;Hello there!&quot;<br>
      return</font><p>Remember, these are the <b>script names</b> of the
      characters. The &quot;return&quot; is essential, because it tells AGS to
      stop running the script at that point and to display the options to the
      player.<p>The numbered entry points will be run when the player selects
      the appropriate option - for example, if the player clicks the &quot;Who
      are you?&quot; option, then entry point&nbsp; @1&nbsp; will run.&nbsp;<p>Here's
      a finished script for this topic:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro8_5.jpg" width="523" height="311"><br>
      Our finished dialog script</i><p>The <i>goto-dialog</i> command takes the
      player to another topic - in this case, topic 1 (with questions about the
      merchant's wares).<br>
      The <i>stop</i> command tells AGS to end the conversation and return to
      the game (whereas <i>return</i> returns them to the list of options to
      talk about).<p>Go to the File menu, and choose &quot;Exit and save
      changes&quot; to save our script. But we're not quite done! We've got to
      deal with our second topic too!<p>Select &quot;Topic 1&quot; in the list,
      and then click the &quot;Edit script&quot; button. Fill it in however you
      like. You can use the <i>goto-previous</i> command to take the player back
      to the first list of options when they get bored of talking about his
      wares.&nbsp;<p>Here's my completed script for topic 1:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro8_6.jpg"><br>
      Dialog script for topic 1</i><p>As you can see, it's done very similarly
      to the first one. Notice the use of &quot;return&quot; in the startup
      entry point, to make sure that it doesn't go on and run the next bit of
      script straight away.<p>We're almost done! All we've got to do now is add
      a way for the player to initiate the conversation.<p>Go back to the
      &quot;Characters&quot; pane, and select your new character (MERCHANT).
      Change his starting room to room 1 (ie. the same as the player character),
      and position him at let's say X:260, Y:130. You can always change this
      later.<p>Now, still with the Merchant selected, click the Interaction
      button. Using your skills from earlier on in this tutorial, add a
      &quot;Game - Run Dialog&quot; command for when the player talks to the
      Merchant. Close the window, save the game, and we're all set!<p>Test the
      game, talk to the Merchant, and try out the conversation.<p><b>More on
      conversations</b><p>You may have noticed the &quot;Show&quot; and
      &quot;Say&quot; tickboxes on the Dialogs pane. You'll have noticed that
      when the player selects an option, the player character will say the
      option text. However, there are times when you won't want this to happen,
      and if you un-tick the &quot;Say&quot; box for an option, the character
      won't repeat the text when the player selects it.<p>The &quot;Show&quot;
      box determines whether the option is initially available to the player. If
      you uncheck it, then that option won't appear to start with. You can
      enable it later using the <i>option-on </i>dialog script command, or the
      &quot;Game - Enable dialog option&quot; interaction command.<p>There is
      also a dialog script command called <i>option-off</i>, which you can use
      to stop a particular option from appearing once the character has found
      out all the vital information. See the manual reference for more.<p>If
      there is only one option enabled for a topic, then the game selects it
      automatically. You can use this to make Sierra-style conversations,
      because the options will never be shown to the player in this case.&nbsp;<p><b>

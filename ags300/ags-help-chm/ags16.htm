<H2>Backing up your game</H2>
You will no doubt want to back up your game files, and should do so regularly during
your game development. But which files should you back up?<P>
When taking a backup, make sure you copy <B>ALL</B> the files listed below:<P>
<UL>

<LI> <B>GAME.AGF</B> - this is the main data file for your game and contains almost
all of the game settings. Without it, your game is lost.
<LI> <B>ACSPRSET.SPR</B> - this is your game's sprite file, containing all the sprites
from the sprite manager.
<LI> <B>ROOM*.CRM</B> - all the ROOM*.CRM files are your room files, and obviously without
one of them you wouldn't be able to go into that room any longer.
<LI> <B>*.ASC, *.ASH</B> - these are your script files, and contain all of your
scripting handywork.
<LI> <B>*.TRS</B> - translation source files. They contain any translations that you've
had done.
<LI> <B>AGSFNT*.TTF, AGSFNT*.WFN</B> - these files contain any fonts you have imported.
</UL>
<P>
Also remember to back up any sound, music and video files you are using.<P>

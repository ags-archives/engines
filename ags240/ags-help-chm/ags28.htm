<H2>Interaction commands</H2>
The following commands are available in response to events in Interaction
windows:<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Go to screen VAL
<DD> changes the player character's current room to the VAL.
If this is in response to one of the screen edge events, the character will
be placed on the opposite side of the screen. Otherwise, you must use the Data
column to specify where on the new screen the man is placed. <P>
You specify which
edge by using these numbers: 1000=left, 2000=right, 3000=bottom, 4000=top.
He will be placed in the middle of that side, unless you add the pixel offset
along the edge, which you can get from the "Mouse Position" label in the
Room Settings pane. For example, Data=2150 would place him near the bottom of
the right-hand side.

</TD>
<DT> (Do nothing)
<DD> nothing happens.

</TD>
<DT> Stop man walking
<DD> the player character stops moving if he is currently
moving.

call the on_event text script event.

<DT> Display message VAL
<DD> displays a message. If the number is below 40, then
the room message of that number will be displayed. If the number is above
500, then the relevant global message is displayed.

</TD>
<DT> Remove object VAL
<DD> turns the specified object off. It will no longer
appear on this screen, until it is turned back on by the "Turn object on"
command.

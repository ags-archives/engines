<H2>Contacting the author</H2>
If you have any comments or suggestions, the first place to go is the AGS
messageboard. Linked off the main AGS website, it's where the AGS community
meets and you will find answers to many questions there.<P>
If you think you've found a bug, if you need help or can't get it to work,
please check the following:<UL>

<LI> That your question is not already answered in this file. AGS has been
painstakingly documented, so PLEASE read this file through before asking
me a question.
<LI> If it is not covered in this file, check the CHANGES.TXT file. If a new
feature has been added then it will be described there, if it has not yet
been added to this manual.
<LI> That you are using the most recent version of AGS. You can find out the
most recent version by checking the website (address below).
You can find out your version by finding the ACWIN.EXE file in Explorer, right-clicking
it, choosing Properties and then the Version tab. The first line should
read "2.xx.yyy.0" (where 2.xx is the version number, and yyy
is the sub-version number).
<LI> If you are receiving an error message, please write down the EXACT message
and any other information which you think is appropriate. PLEASE WRITE THE
EXACT ERROR MESSAGE TEXT, don't just say "I get a message about it not being
able to find a file".
<LI> If you are getting lock-ups or techno-garbage printouts, please try to
give a situation which causes the problem. For instance, if you notice that
it only happens on certain screens, or only if there is an object, etc then
please state that - it makes replying a lot easier and faster.
</UL>

Whatever the problem, if you can't solve it then post to the messageboard
for help. I also read the messageboard quite regularly, so chances are
someone will be able to help you.<P>
Please only e-mail me as a last resort, as I get too much e-mail as it is
and I actually check the messageboard more frequently than my mail.<P>
<B>IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT e-mail me your game.</B> When you have a demo or
full game to show off, please post it on the AGS Announcements forum. There's
nothing more annoying than wanting to quickly check my mail only to find it
"Downloading message 1" for hours on end while it gets your 5 Mb attachment.<P>
<I>NOTE:</I> If you want to mail me an attachment to demonstrate a problem you are
having, PLEASE COMPRESS IT using WinZip, PKZIP, etc and send it to me as a
zip file. I don't have the time or money to download massive 500 k BMP files
which compress to 20 k when zipped - if you send me an uncompressed BMP then
I will not respond to your mail. Also, please get permission in advance before
sending me any attachments at all, or your message may get automatically deleted.<P>
<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> I usually check my e-mail two or three times a week, so give me
about a week to reply before assuming your message didn't get through. The
same applies to the message board.<P>

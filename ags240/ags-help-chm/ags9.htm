<H2>Creating the game</H2>
On loading the AGS Editor, you will be prompted for whether you want to create
a new game or continue an existing one. Select New Game, and press the OK button.
You will then be prompted for a name for the game. This must be under 8 characters, and
is only used for the file name that your game is saved as - you can type a proper length
game name later.<P>
Now, you need to decide at this point whether you're making a 256-colour game or a
hi-colour game. 256-colour games have a lower system requirement, since they run faster,
and they allow you to do palette effects. However, managing the palette is quite complex
so you may wish to start off with a 16-bit colour game.<P>
Click on "Palette" in the left-hand tree window. You will see the palette display on the
right. If you wish to use hi-colour, click the "Convert game to hi-colour" button now.<P>

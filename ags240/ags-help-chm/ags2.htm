Adventure Game Studio (or AGS for short) allows you to create your own
point-and-click adventure games, like the older Sierra games (Space Quest 4,
King's Quest 5-6, etc). It includes an easy-to-use Integrated Development
Environment, and you do not need any programming experience to make a game
using it.<P>
For more advanced users, AGS supports scripting, where you can write a sort
of program which allows you to have great control over the game.<P>
By default, AGS will create Sierra-style adventure games, with the pop-up icon
bar, and right-click cycles through the modes (walk, look, use, speak).
However, you can change the interface completely using the Interface Editor
to make Lucasarts-style or any other type of interface you want.
AGS handles many parts of the system for you, like load/save game, character
movement and object animations.<P>
(You may have known this program previously as the Adventure Creator. AGS v2
replaced Adventure Creator over 3 years ago now - if you still have a game made
with AC, grab a copy of AGS v2.00 to upgrade it).<P>

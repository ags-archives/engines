Only one text script can be executing at any one time. A script is considered
to be "executing" if there is still code left in a script function that needs
to be executed.<P>
What this means is that if you call a function like MoveCharacterToObject,
which is BLOCKING - that is, it waits until the character finishes moving
before continuing the script - then while the character is moving no other
scripts will be run (for example, repeatedly_execute scripts).<P>

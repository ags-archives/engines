      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Using your own graphics</h3>
      <p>When you were choosing the graphics for the object earlier in this
      tutorial, you probably noticed that the graphics available didn't look up
      to much. This is no problem, because you can import your own graphics
      using the Sprite Manager.</p>
      <p>Select the <i>&quot;Sprite manager&quot;</i> in the left-hand tree.
      Here you will see the complete sprite set for the game.</p>
      <p>AGS uses sprites for all game graphics, except room backgrounds. The
      Sprite Manager is the central place where you do all your graphics
      importing. Whenever you want to use images in the game (eg. for mouse
      cursors, characters, objects, and so forth), you select an image to use
      from here.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to import your graphics - either overwrite an
      existing slot with your graphic, or create a new slot for it. To overwrite
      an existing sprite, right-click the sprite and select <i>&quot;Import over
      this sprite&quot;</i>. To import a new slot, right-click on the background
      of the window and choose <i>&quot;Import new sprite&quot;</i>.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_1.jpg" width="479" height="316"><br>
      I'm about to overwrite sprite slot 3</i></p>
      <p>When you select this menu option, the <i>Import Image</i> window will
      pop up:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_2.jpg" width="400" height="200"><br>
      The &quot;Import Image&quot; window</i><p>The first thing to do is to set
      what resolution the image is drawn for. Basically, if you are making a
      640x480 game, you need to check the &quot;Import for 640x400
      resolution&quot; box <b>before</b> going any further. If you are making a
      320x200 game, leave it unchecked.<p>Now, you can either:
      <ul>
        <li>click the <i>&quot;Import from file...&quot;</i> button, and the
          file selector will pop up. Find the image file you want to import, and
          it will appear in the window.</li>
        <li>click the <i>&quot;Paste from clipboard&quot;</i> button. The
          current clipboard image will appear in the window.<br>
          (<b>NOTE:</b> The <i>&quot;Paste from clipboard&quot;</i> button is not
          available in 256-colour games)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The sprite graphics you import must be the same colour depth as your
      backgrounds - ie. if you have a 256-colour game, you must import
      256-colour sprites.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_3.jpg" width="400" height="375"><br>
      Ok, so I didn't have any decent sprite graphics on my disk.</i><p>Now, the
      image should be displayed. You may get scroll bars if it's larger than the
      window can handle. You'll notice that a new button, <i>&quot;Grab entire
      image&quot;</i> has appeared.<br>
      <br>
      <table border="0" id="table3">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td><i><b>NOTE</b> (256-colour only): </i>You may well find that the
            colours on your graphic look slightly strange in the Room Editor.
            This is because by default only the
            first 41 of the palette colours are allocated to sprites, so your graphic will be remapped to
            this much smaller palette. If you find that many of your imported
            sprites look strange, you can increase the number of colours
            assigned to sprites, at the expense of background colours (see the
            earlier part of the tutorial for palette setup).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Move the mouse cursor over the image, and you'll see a rectangle
      following the cursor around. This is the selection rectangle that
      determines what portion of the image will be imported. Click and drag the <b>right
      </b>mouse button to resize it.<p>If you just want to import the entire
      image as your sprite, simply click the <i>&quot;Grab entire image&quot;</i>
      button. Otherwise, move and size the selection rectangle so that it covers
      what you want to import, and click the <b>left </b>mouse button. The
      &quot;Zoom out&quot; and &quot;Zoom in&quot; buttons allow you to zoom in
      on the sprite to see more detail if you need to precisely align your
      import rectangle.
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> For character graphics, make sure you import graphics that 
		are a suitable size for the game backgrounds. For example, don't import 
		a 320x200-sized image for your character, since it will take up the 
		whole screen. A good size would be about 20x50 pixels.<h4>Tiled sprite import</h4>
      <p>This feature allows you to import a grid of sprites into seperate slots
      - for example, if you have several frames of a character animation side by
      side in the source bitmap. To do this, simply check the &quot;Tiled sprite
      import&quot; box, and align your rectangle on the top left sprite. When
      you click the left mouse button, you will get an extra step which allows
      you to size the grid:<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro6_4.jpg" width="400" height="375"><br>
      I've sized a 3x1 grid, to import each traffic light seperately</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p>Click the left button again once you are happy with the grid. Each of
      the cells will be imported as a seperate sprite.<p>For full details on
      importing sprites, see the manual <i>&quot;Importing your own sprite
      graphics&quot;</i> section.
